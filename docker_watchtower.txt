Instructions

Welcome to the second learning activity! In this learning activity, you will be using Watchtower to monitor containers for updates. In order to complete this learning activity, you will need a Docker Hub account.

Log in to your live environment and sudo to root.
Create the Dockerfile

    The base image should be node.
    Using the RUN instruction, make a directory called /var/node.
    Use the ADD instruction to add the contents of the code directory into /var/node.
    Make /var/node the working directory.
    Execute an npm install.
    Set ./bin/www as the command.
    From the command line, log in to Docker Hub.
    Build your image using <USERNAME>/express.
    Push the image to Docker Hub.

Create the demo app

    Create a Docker container called demo-app.
    The port mapping should be port 80 on the host, mapping to 3000 on the container.
    The restart policy should be set to always.
    Use the image that you created, <USERNAME>/express.

Create the Watchtower container

    Create a Docker container called watchtower.
    The restart policy should be set to always.
    Use the -v flag to set /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock.
    Use the v2tec/watchtower followed by the -i flag to set the iteration to 30 seconds.

Update the Docker image

    Add an instruction to create /var/test. This should be done after creating /var/node.
    Rebuild your image.
    Push the image to Docker Hub.

Watchtower will update demo-app

    The Watchtower interval is set to 30 seconds.
    After about 30 seconds, check to see if the container has been updated by executing docker ps.

Objectives
help
Create the Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile:

vi Dockerfile

The Dockerfile should contain the following:

FROM node

RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD content-express-demo-app/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
CMD ./bin/www

help
Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t USERNAME/express -f Dockerfile .

help
Push the Image to Docker Hub

Login to Docker Hub:

docker login

Push the image to Docker Hub:

docker push USERNAME/express

help
Create a Demo Container

Create the container that Watchtower will monitor:

 docker run -d --name demo-app -p 80:3000 --restart always USERNAME/express

help
Create the Watchtower Container

Create the Watchtower container that will monitor the demo-app container:

docker run -d --name watchtower --restart always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock v2tec/watchtower -i 30

help
Update the Docker Image

Update the Docker image:

docker build -t USERNAME/express -f Dockerfile .
