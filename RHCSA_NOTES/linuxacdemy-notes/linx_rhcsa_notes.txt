HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD (RED HAT LINUX)

1. Reboot machine 
# At GRUB bootloader
When prompt to select OS press 'e'(for edit mode)

2. Locate the kernel line and navigate to the end of the line.
Add 'rd.break' (Ram Disk break)

3. Continue with bootup by pressing ctrl+x

4. mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd
typed password twice
touch /.autorelabel
exit﻿

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT/USER PASSWORD (Ubuntu 16.04)

# This was performed and successful on my infoset-ng server (andre@suerte) 
# IP address 10.0.0.100

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

TWO OPTIONS TO CONTINUE:

OPTION 1: Delete everything after 'ro'(sometimes it will say splash screen....) and append the following:

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

# add this:
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root rw init=/bin/bash

Press ctrl+x to continue reboot

You will now be in /bin/bash as root like so:
root@(None):/# 

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

Exit by running:
exit

****************************
OPTION 2:

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

3. Now instead of deleting anything we can just add to at the end like so:

root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro init=/bin/bash

4. Press ctrl+x to continue boot

5. Here is where it differs from OPTION 1
- at the moment we don't have the ability to 'write' on the file system, only 'read'(ro)
- you can verify this by running:
mount 

Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (ro,relatime,data=ordered)

To write to the file system:
mount -o remount,rw / 
this allows us to now read and write to the file system at / (root).

check that you have ability to 'rw'
Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

How can we change root password
Here are a few ways I can think of, from the least intrusive to the most intrusive.

Without Rebooting
With sudo: if you have sudo permissions to run passwd, you can do:

$ sudo passwd root

Enter your password, then enter a new password for root twice. Done.

Editing files: this works in the unlikely case you don't have full sudo access, but you do have access to edit /etc/{passwd,shadow}. Open /etc/shadow, either with sudoedit /etc/shadow, or with sudo $EDITOR /etc/shadow. Replace root's password field (all the random characters between the second and third colons :) with your own user's password field. Save. The local has the same password as you. Log in and change the password to something else.

###############################################################################################

HOW TO LIST ALL USERS ON SYSTEM WITH A HOME DIRECTORY

1. Run as Root
2. # cat /etc/passwd | grep /home*


##############################################################################################

***PRACTICE RHCSA QUESTIONS***

1. Set up an account for a new System Administrator, Jason, who has just joined your team. His full name is Jason Doe, his shell is bash, he is a member of a new group called admin. His user quota at /home is 100Mb.Jason can execute any command as root but has to supply his own password at each request.


1.Run as Root (su -)

2. # create the group admin with a gid(group ID) of 601
command: groupadd -g 601 admin

3. # add the user to group 601, allow shell access in /bin/bash, add a home directory at /home/jason, -c comment full name

command: useradd -g 601 -s /bin/bash -d /home/jason -c "Jason Doe" jason

How to search the linux repository for a specific program name:
# use this command to search for what you think a program is called. 
apt-cache will return similar results to help you determine the exact name of the program you are looking for along with a short description.
# be sure to use a (*) at the end of the program name to include 'all' files 
when searching.

	$ sudo apt-cache search <name of program*>
	$ sudo apt-cache search Django*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To repeat the previous command use:

	$ sudo !!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To switch users use:

	$ su <name of user>
	$ su carolina
	$ su andre

# To change to Root user use:

	# 'Super user do, super user'.
	$ sudo su

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To manage packages/install, remove, update, and upgrade  use the 'apt-get' program
# command usage: sudo apt-get <action> <file or program you want action performed on>
# example:
	$ sudo apt-get install <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get install bluefish

# To remove a program use:
	$ sudo apt-get remove <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get remove bluefish

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To make a 'matrix' style effect on command line use this:

	$ while (true) do echo -n "your message"; done

# To kill task: ctrl z

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To check if a program or specific package is install on your local machine use:

	$ apt-cache policy <name of program>
	$ apt-cache policy python3
	output:
		python3:
			Installed: 3.5.1-3
			Candidate: 3.5.1-3
		Version table:
			*** 3.5.1-3 500
			500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
			100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

# This will tell you if it exists on the machine and where it is installed.

# To check a known non-exsistant program output look like the following:
	$ apt-cache policy bluefish
	output:
		bluefish:
		  Installed: (none)
		  Candidate: 2.2.7-2
		Version table:
		2.2.7-2 500
		500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages

# Installed = NONE

# FILE PERMISSIONS AND FILE OWNERSHIP
--------------------------------------

USE:  
	$ ls -l (list with 'long view) 
to show files with permissions and user/groups

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

drwxrwxr-x 2 andre andre  4096 Jun 17 17:44 Command_Line_Notes

In the order of output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.exe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-file permissions (drwxrwxr)
number of links (1)
owner name (root)
owner group (root)
file size (2048)
time of last modification, and
file/directory name (Jan 13 07:11 <name of file/directory>

File permissions is displayed as following:

first character is - or l or d
d-  indicates a directory.
a line(hyphen) represents a file.
l-  is a symlink (or soft link) - special type of file.

three sets of characters, three times, indicating permissions for owner, group and other:
r = readable
w = writable
x = executable

In the example out put above -rwxrw-r--, this means the line displayed is:

a regular file (displayed as -)
readable, writable and executable by owner (rwx)
readable, writable, but not executable by group (rw-)
readable but not writable or executable by other (r--)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



# chown = 'Change ownership' - change to a specific user or 'Root'
command:
	$ chown user:group <name of file/directory> (can also specify a direct path (usr/env<name of file>)

# chmod = 'Change permissions' - allowing what can and can not be done to a specific file or directory.

NOTE**** You can add -R to both chown, and chmod to make the command recursive to all files in a directory.

EXAMPLE:
	chown -R user:group <name of directory>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command syntax[edit]

	$ chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...][3]

Usual implemented options include:

-R recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories
-f force, forge ahead with all objects even if errors occur
-v verbose, show objects processed
If a symbolic link is specified, the target object is affected. File modes directly associated with symbolic links themselves are typically never used.

To view the file mode, the ls or stat commands may be used:

$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh

-rwxr-xr--  1 dgerman  staff  823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh
$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh

754

The r, w, and x specify the read, write, and execute access, respectively. The first character of the ls display denotes the object type;
a hyphen represents a plain file. This script can be read, written to, and executed by the owner, read and executed by other members of the staff group and can also be read by others.

Octal modes[edit]
See also: Octal notation of file system permissions

The chmod numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. 
The three rightmost digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users.
The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special setuid, setgid, and sticky flags.

Numerical permissions

#	Permission	rwx
7	read, write and execute	rwx
6	read and write	rw-
5	read and execute	r-x
4	read only	r--
3	write and execute	-wx
2	write only	-w-
1	execute only	--x
0	none	---
Numeric example[edit]
In order to permit all users who are members of the programmers group to update a file

	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-r--r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
	$ chmod 664 sharedFile
	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
Since the setuid, setgid and sticky bits are not specified, this is equivalent to:

	$ chmod 0664 sharedFile

In Linux, what does the d mean in the first position of drwxr-xr-x? And what are all of the possible letters that could be there, and what do they mean?

I'm trying to learn more about the Linux file permissions system, and I'd like to see a list of the character meanings for the first slot.

It means that it is a directory. The first mode field is the "special file" designator; regular files display as - (none). As for which possible letters could be there, on Linux the following exist:

d (directory)
c (character device)
l (symlink)
p (named pipe)
s (socket)
b (block device)
D (door, not common on Linux systems, but has been ported)

# Creating New files, directories. Removing and deleting files/directories

Commands:

	$ touch - creates files
EXAMPLE:
	$ touch <nameoffile.extension_type>

	$ touch file.txt file2.txt file3.txt file.py file4.cpp file5.html file6.html
** This creates 6 new files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mkdir(make directory)- creates a new empty directory

cp(copy)- how to copy files to a new location

	$ cp <name of target file> <specific directory path>
	$ cp pythonNotes /Documents/tutorials/python

** WHEN INSIDE OF SPECIFIC DIRECTORY**
rm(remove)- removes files and directories
	$ rm file.txt

To remove all files from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm ./*

To remove all files with a specific file extension use:
	$ rm ./*.<extension_type>
	$ rm ./*.html

** WHEN NOT IN SPECIFIC DIRECTORY **

To remove all file from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm <nameofdirectory>/*
	$ rm Documents/*

To remove the directory use:
	$ rm -rf <nameofdirectory>
	$ rm -rf schoolnotes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To move a file use:
	$ mv filename <destination>
	$ mv file1.txt /Documents/newdir

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIND COMMAND***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# use this to find specific files, file extensions, file sizes, as well as specific directories.

Command:
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"
	
	# you can also specify a specific directory in the search like so
	# This command reads as: 
		find in the /etc directory all file types, ignore case and return all with a .conf extension.
	$ find /etc -type f -iname "*.conf"



$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"

find = command
. = in the current directory
-type f = the type we are searching for is 'f' for file.
-iname = means to ignore case (upper/lower) this will return all
"" = name of specific file or name of specific extension type
* = wild card for searching for ALL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GREP Command***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Use grep to find specific items within a file

Command:
	$ grep <"what you are looking for> <name of file to look in>
	$ grep "function" file1.py

# Search all files within current directory, ignoring case(case insensitive)
	$ grep -i "function" ./*


***USE THIS COMMAND TO SEARCH FOR MOST INSTANCES WITHIN A FILE****
# Search and return with line number where instances of the search string are found.
	$ grep -i -n "config" ./*


# *** YOU CAN ALSO USE GREP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 'FIND' COMMAND***

	# you can run a find command as normal and at the end of the command add the flag -exec(execute)
	# -exec takes the grep command argument
	# at the end of your grep command you need to end the statement with {} +


	# this will search and find and return...
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.php" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} +

		-find in the current directory
		-all file types
		-ignoring case(case insensitive)
		-search all with .php extentions
		THEN
		- Execute grep
		- ignoring case
		- show line numbers
		- return 'config' as search
		- {} + end the execute statement

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Redirect the output of a command to a file by printing and creating a file to add output in.
	- you do this by running the command on the output source
	Example:
		$ find . -type f -size -20k -iname "*.py" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} + | tee drelog.txt

	# This searches the current directory looking for files less than 20 kilobytes with the .py extention. 
	# Then executes grep case insensitive, displaying line numbers searching for string 'config' 
	# Then it pipes the result into a file named 'drelog.txt' as well as prints the output to the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# PROCESSES

# Use 'top' or 'htop' to view in real-time current processes.

# To view all background tasks use the command:
	$ ps aux

# To view a specific app or program use ps aux and pipe the app or program as the argument.
	$ ps aux | python3

# To view processor ID's (PID) use the command pgrep.
	$ pgrep chrome

# To kill a single app or process use grep to return the proccessor id and then kill it based on it's id.
	$ pgrep chrome
		output:
		1568
		3369
		1497
		7812
	# To kill a specific process use this command.
		$ kill -9 1497

# Likewise to kill all of the proccesses use:
	$ killall chrome

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Why you don't have a root password

While you can create a password for the superuser account allowing you to log in as root with su, it's worth mentioning that this isn't the "Ubuntu" way of doing things. Ubuntu have specifically chosen not to give a root login and password by default for a reason. Instead, a default Ubuntu install will use sudo.

Sudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties. In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given "sudo" permission by default.

Anybody with "sudo" permission may perform something "as a superuser" by pre-pending sudo to their command. For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
You will see this usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web. It's an alternative to doing this.

su
apt-get dist-upgrade
exit

With sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password. If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password. You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user. And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.

Sudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges. With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout. This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.

With sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:

sudo su
... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.

And similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.

However when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command. It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).

Just to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root as described in @Oli's answer, if you specifically want to do things this way instead. I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.

# Some useful commands for providing 'help' within the terminal environment.
1. Use man-pages of (man <command> -- these pages give a great over-view of the command and any additional arguments.
2. Use '--help' (E.g cp --help)-- This provides a quick reference of how a command should be structured. Args within [](square brackets) are optional. Args that are NOT in [] are required.
3. Use 'info' (info <command>) -- Much like the man pages, these provide info in addition to the 'man-pages'.
4. If you know of a command but can't rememeber the exact name, you can search the system. You do this by using the 'apropos' command (E.g apropos cp).

Gzip and bzip2 are functionally equivalent. (There once was a bzip, but it seems to have completely vanished off the face of the world.) Other common compression formats are zip, rar and 7z; these three do both compression and archiving (packing multiple files into one). Here are some typical ratings in terms of speed, availability and typical compression ratio (note that these ratings are somewhat subjective, don't take them as gospel):

decompression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > 7z > rar > bzip2
compression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > bzip2 > 7z > rar
compression ratio (better > worse): 7z > rar, bzip2 > gzip > zip
availability (unix): gzip > bzip2 > zip > 7z > rar
availability (windows): zip > rar > 7z > gzip, bzip2
As you can see, there isn't a clear winner. If you want to rely on programs that are likely to be installed already, use zip on Windows (or if possible, self-extracting archives, as Windows doesn't ship with any of these) and gzip on unix. If you want maximum compression, use 7z.

Rar also has downside that, as far as I know, there is no free software that creates rar archives or that can unpack all rar archives. The other formats have free implementations and no (serious) patent claims.

# Archiving a directory to a file using tar

tar -czvf [destination_name].tar.gz or .tgz(also common) [original dir]
***NOTE: arg 'f' MUST be the LAST ARGUMENT otherwise you will receive an error*****

E.g: tar -czvf jupyternotebookbackup.tar.gz jupyternotebook/
# now ls or ll the .tar.gz file and notice the file size... rather large and not practical for email or sending. In this case we need to compress the file using gzip.

command: gzip [*.tar.gz file]

# In order to view the contents of the tar file run:
tar -tf [*.tar.gz]

How to unzip .tgz file using the terminal
To extract a .tgz file with tar you need to use,

tar -xvzf /path/to/yourfile.tgz
where,

x for extract
v for verbose
z for gnuzip
f for file, should come at last just before file name.

FILE TRANSFER THROUGH SSH USING 1. SCP or 2.SFTP
(Please read the man pages for these)

Both scp and sftp use the ssh port 22 because it is encrypted this is the safe way of file 
transfering. NOTE!!! 'Telnet' is unsecure and should be avoided if possible.


# scp [file...file...file] username@ip_address(:and specify where to put the files)
# (eg below.. transfering test1-4 into CentOS remote server and placing the files into the 
user's home directory.

$ scp test1 test2 test3 test4 user@52.90.15.86:~/

SFTP:

$ sftp username@ip_address

Once logged into remote server you are able to run most linux commands.

# transfers file from the REMOTE SERVER --> LOCAL HOST
# think... put file on LOCAL HOST
$ put file_name

# transfers file from the LOCAL HOST --> REMOTE SERVER
# think... get file from LOCAL HOST
$ get file_name

TO EXIT SFTP:
type: 'bye, exit or quit'

IF DISK DOES NOT WANT TO UNMOUNT
*******************************************

Example:
root@andre-ThinkPad-S3-Yoga-14:/mnt/usb_drive# umount /mnt/usb_drive 
umount: /mnt/usb_drive: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)


Solution: Solved by https://chrisjean.com/forcing-a-device-to-unmount-in-ubuntu-linux/

FORCING a Device to Unmount in Ubuntu Linux

I recently ran into an issue where a mounted SSHFS filesystem refused to unmount.

I tried to unmount it from inside Nautilus by right-clicking the mount and selecting Unmount, but this failed with an error message. The error told me that it couldn’t unmount the device and gave a reason of “mount disagrees with the fstab”.

I then edited the fstab (sudo vi /etc/fstab) and commented out the entry for the device. I tried to unmount in Nautilus again, but this time it told me that I couldn’t unmount the device because I wasn’t root and the device was not listed in fstab. I then uncommented the previously commented line and saved the file again.

Time to get dirty. I tried to manually run umount, but it failed:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo umount /mnt/share
umount: /mnt/share: device is busy.
        (In some cases useful info about processes that use
        the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))
[chris@home ~]$ 
This was getting personal now as the previous messages said nothing about the device being in use. I closed out every application and tried again. Same error message.

I followed the instructions and ran man lsof followed by man fuser to find out more about those recommended commands. fuser was the winner.

fuser allows you to find out detailed information about processes that are using specific files or sockets. In addition to getting information, it allows you to kill processes accessing the file or socket. This was exactly what I was looking for.

After reading up on the fuser syntax, I ran the following:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo fuser -km /mnt/share
/mnt/share/: 9004c
[chris@home ~]$ 
This command basically translates into “find every process that is accessing the /mnt/share mount point and kill it”. Since I was unsure of the ownership of the processes that would be killed, I ran it with sudo to make sure that any processes could be killed.

The /mnt/share/: 9004c response means that a process with an ID of 9004 was terminated.

Again, I ran:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo umount /mnt/share
[chris@home ~]$ 
This command cheerily replied with nothing, which is a good sign as it means that the umount command succeeded.

Finally, the mount is unmounted. Now if only I could remember what I was trying to do when this problem happened…

NOTE: ALSO TRY: umount -l (-l for lazy)

HOW TO CONFIGURE LOCAL YUM REPO IN REDHAT LINUX 7

************************************************************

1. Start rhel virtual machine (virtualbox)
2. Make sure to have iso of redhat7.* (dvd.iso)
3. ssh into virtual server

# mount the iso

root@vmrhel:#] mount rhel-server-7.1-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt
---> this should mount the iso as /dev/loop*(usally a number 0-9) (e.g /dev/loop1

# cd into its mount point(/mnt/)
# create directory to contain packages from dvd
root@vmrhel:#] mkdir -p /data/pack


# copy all package files from iso to /data/pack dir
# cd into the dvd.iso and into the 'packages' directory
root@vmrhel:#] cp -rvf * /data/pack

NOTE: This will take some time
*************************************************************************

UNMOUNT ISO

# cd out of the iso mount in order to unmount properly

root@vmrhel:#] umount /dev/loop0

# cd into /data/pack/Packages

# create the repo
root@vmrhel:#] ls | grep -i createrepo
<createrepo-0.9.9-23.el7.noarch.rpm>

# install the package
root@vmrhel:#] rpm -ivh <package_name> ----> root@vmrhel:#] rpm -ivh createrepo-0.9.9-23.el7.noarch.rpm

* Here you might need to install some dependencies   -------> use 'yum install [dependency_package]'

# confirm you are in the /data/pack dir

# create the repo file
root@vmrhel:#] createrepo -v .  ------> (NOTE: the '.' for current working directory)

# now cd back to root home dir
root@vmrhel:#] cd

# add the repo
root@vmrhel:#] yum-config-manager --add="rhel"

# edit the newly created repo config file
root@vmrhel:#] vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.repo

How to SSH to a VirtualBox guest externally through a host
***********************************************************************

The best way to login to a guest Linux VirtualBox VM is port forwarding. By default, you should have one interface already which is using NAT. Then go to the Network settings and click the Port Forwarding button. Add a new Rule:

Host port 3022, guest port 22, name ssh, other left blank.


from command line:

VBoxManage modifyvm "myserver" --natpf1 "ssh,tcp,,3022,,22"
where 'myserver' is the name of the created VM. Check the added rules:

VBoxManage showvminfo "myserver" | grep 'Rule'
That's all! Please be sure you don't forget to install an SSH server:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
To SSH into the guest VM, write:

ssh -p 3022 user@127.0.0.1
Where user is your username within the VM.

Exercise: Filesystem ACLs

Create a second user on the system called "starbuck".  Open a second terminal window for the lab server, and connect as the user starbuck. Ensure you're working as a priviledged user (sudo) or root user while perofrming the lab. The starbuck user will be used to test setting the permissions.
Navigate into the /tmp directory, create two new directories named "dir1" and "dir2" and two files called "file1" and "file2".
Idenity if any of the files currently have extended access control lists associated with them.
Set an ACL for the starbuck user to read and write for file1.
Set the mask on the file1 to read only, then as the starbuck user, attempt to execute the following command: echo "test" > /tmp/file1. Why does this fail?
Set the default permissions on dir1 to read, write and execute for the starbuck user; execute only if it is a directory.
Using setfacl, change the "other" permissions to none on file1.
Remove the default permissions from dir1.
Remove all ACLs on file1.

*******************************************************************************************************************************

SOULTION EXERCISE : FILESYSTEM ACLS

1. Create a second user on the system called "starbuck".  Open a second terminal window for the lab server, and connect as the user starbuck. Ensure you're working as a priviledged user (sudo) or root user while perofrming the lab. The starbuck user will be used to test setting the permissions.

[root@localhost ~]# useradd starbuck; passwd starbuck
Changing password for user starbuck.
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
2. Navigate into the /tmp directory, create two new directories named "dir1" and "dir2" and two files called "file1" and "file2".

[root@localhost tmp]# mkdir {dir1,dir2}; touch {file1,file2}
3. Idenity if any of the files currently have extended access control lists associated with them.

[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2
Note: The files have base ACLs but do not have extended ACLs. We know they do not have extended ACLs because of the lacl of "+" at the end of the permissions listed.

4. Set an ACL for the starbuck user to read and write for file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m u:starbuck:rw file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:starbuck:rw-
group::r--
mask::rw-
other::r--
5. Set the mask on the file1 to read only, then as the starbuck user, attempt to execute the following command: echo "test" > /tmp/file1. Why does this fail?

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m m::r file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:starbuck:rw- #effective:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::r--
Starbuck's Terminal
[starbuck@localhost tmp]$ echo "test "> /tmp/file1
-bash: /tmp/file1: Permission denied
Summary: Starbuck was unable to write to file1 even though they had an ACL with rw, because the mask was setting the "maximum" permissions to r and was masking w.

6. Set the default permissions on dir1 to read, write and execute for the starbuck user; execute only if it is a directory.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -d -m u:starbuck:rwX dir1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1
# file: dir1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:user:starbuck:rwx
default:group::r-x
default:mask::rwx
default:other::r-x
7. Using setfacl, change the "other" permissions to none on file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m o::- file1
[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2
-rw-rw----+ 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2
8. Remove the default permissions from dir1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-default dir1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1
# file: dir1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
9. Remove all ACLs on file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-all file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
other::---

umask default makes files as 666(rw-rw-rw) read, write permissions on owner:group:other
umask default for directories is 777 (rwX-rwX-rwX) read, write and execute permissions on owner:group:other

**Notice** how directories by default allow execution, this is because execution is needed in order to change directory(cd) into. However, you do not need execute permissions to ls or cat into a dir.

CREATE AND MANAGE ACCESS CONTROL LISTS (ACLs)
*********************************************************

# file systems that support ACLs by default are 'xfs' and 'ext4'

# create a new user named 'starbuck'
# set the password with 
$ passwd starbuck

# open two terminal windows, one as root and one as starbuck

# cd into /tmp/ directory on both the root and starbuck, this is to demonstrate privledges.

# getfacl - get file access control lists
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--

For  each file, getfacl displays the file name, owner, the group, and the Access Con‐
       trol List (ACL). If a directory has a default ACL, getfacl also displays the  default
       ACL. Non-directories cannot have default ACLs.

       If  getfacl is used on a file system that does not support ACLs, getfacl displays the
       access permissions defined by the traditional file mode permission bits.

       The output format of getfacl is as follows:
	       1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  # owner: lisa
               3:  # group: staff
               4:  # flags: -s-
               5:  user::rwx
               6:  user:joe:rwx               #effective:r-x
               7:  group::rwx                 #effective:r-x
               8:  group:cool:r-x
               9:  mask::r-x
              10:  other::r-x
              11:  default:user::rwx
              12:  default:user:joe:rwx       #effective:r-x
              13:  default:group::r-x
              14:  default:mask::r-x
              15:  default:other::---

       Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning group.
       
       Line 4 indicates the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky (t) bits: either  the  letter
       representing  the bit, or else a dash (-). This line is included if any of those bits
       is set and left out otherwise, so it will not be shown for most files.  (See  CONFOR‐
       MANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17 below.)

       Lines  5,  7  and  10 correspond to the user, group and other fields of the file mode
       permission bits. These three are called the base ACL entries. Lines 6 and 8 are named
       user  and named group entries. Line 9 is the effective rights mask. This entry limits
       the effective rights granted to all groups and to named users. (The  file  owner  and
       others  permissions  are not affected by the effective rights mask; all other entries
       are.)  Lines 11--15 display the default ACL associated with this directory.  Directo‐
       ries may have a default ACL. Regular files never have a default ACL.

       The  default behavior for getfacl is to display both the ACL and the default ACL, and
       to include an effective rights comment for lines where the rights of the entry differ
       from the effective rights.

       If  output  is  to  a terminal, the effective rights comment is aligned to column 40.
       Otherwise, a single tab character separates the ACL entry and  the  effective  rights
       comment.

       The  ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.  The output of get‐
       facl can also be used as input to setfacl.

       PERMISSIONS
       Process with search access to a file (i.e., processes with read access  to  the  con‐
       taining  directory  of a file) are also granted read access to the file's ACLs.  This
       is analogous to the permissions required for accessing the file mode.
********************************************************************************************************************

SETTING THE ACL ON A SPECIFIC USER
**Note** you can either pass the username or the user id

How can I find my User ID UID from terminal?

There are a couple of ways:

Using the id command you can get the real and effective user and group IDs.

id -u <username>
If no username is supplied to id, it will default to the current user.

Using the enviroment variable.

echo $UID

******************************************************************************************************

# set the acl on (u)ser 'starbuck' by (m)odifying the the file permissions to (r)ead, (w)rite.
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# setfacl -m u:starbuck:rw file1

**NOTE** you can also use the $UID (user id)
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# setfacl -m u:1003:rw file1

# get starbuck's uid
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# id -u starbuck
1003

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD (RED HAT LINUX)

1. Reboot machine 
# At GRUB bootloader
When prompt to select OS press 'e'(for edit mode)

2. Locate the kernel line and navigate to the end of the line.
Add 'rd.break' (Ram Disk break)

3. Continue with bootup by pressing ctrl+x

4. mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd
typed password twice
touch /.autorelabel
exit﻿

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT/USER PASSWORD (Ubuntu 16.04)

# This was performed and successful on my infoset-ng server (andre@suerte) 
# IP address 10.0.0.100

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

TWO OPTIONS TO CONTINUE:

OPTION 1: Delete everything after 'ro'(sometimes it will say splash screen....) and append the following:

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

# add this:
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root rw init=/bin/bash

Press ctrl+x to continue reboot

You will now be in /bin/bash as root like so:
root@(None):/# 

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

Exit by running:
exit

****************************
OPTION 2:

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

3. Now instead of deleting anything we can just add to at the end like so:

root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro init=/bin/bash

4. Press ctrl+x to continue boot

5. Here is where it differs from OPTION 1
- at the moment we don't have the ability to 'write' on the file system, only 'read'(ro)
- you can verify this by running:
mount 

Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (ro,relatime,data=ordered)

To write to the file system:
mount -o remount,rw / 
this allows us to now read and write to the file system at / (root).

check that you have ability to 'rw'
Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

How can we change root password
Here are a few ways I can think of, from the least intrusive to the most intrusive.

Without Rebooting
With sudo: if you have sudo permissions to run passwd, you can do:

$ sudo passwd root

Enter your password, then enter a new password for root twice. Done.

Editing files: this works in the unlikely case you don't have full sudo access, but you do have access to edit /etc/{passwd,shadow}. Open /etc/shadow, either with sudoedit /etc/shadow, or with sudo $EDITOR /etc/shadow. Replace root's password field (all the random characters between the second and third colons :) with your own user's password field. Save. The local has the same password as you. Log in and change the password to something else.

###############################################################################################

HOW TO LIST ALL USERS ON SYSTEM WITH A HOME DIRECTORY

1. Run as Root
2. # cat /etc/passwd | grep /home*


##############################################################################################

***PRACTICE RHCSA QUESTIONS***

1. Set up an account for a new System Administrator, Jason, who has just joined your team. His full name is Jason Doe, his shell is bash, he is a member of a new group called admin. His user quota at /home is 100Mb.Jason can execute any command as root but has to supply his own password at each request.


1.Run as Root (su -)

2. # create the group admin with a gid(group ID) of 601
command: groupadd -g 601 admin

3. # add the user to group 601, allow shell access in /bin/bash, add a home directory at /home/jason, -c comment full name

command: useradd -g 601 -s /bin/bash -d /home/jason -c "Jason Doe" jason

How to search the linux repository for a specific program name:
# use this command to search for what you think a program is called. 
apt-cache will return similar results to help you determine the exact name of the program you are looking for along with a short description.
# be sure to use a (*) at the end of the program name to include 'all' files 
when searching.

	$ sudo apt-cache search <name of program*>
	$ sudo apt-cache search Django*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To repeat the previous command use:

	$ sudo !!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To switch users use:

	$ su <name of user>
	$ su carolina
	$ su andre

# To change to Root user use:

	# 'Super user do, super user'.
	$ sudo su

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To manage packages/install, remove, update, and upgrade  use the 'apt-get' program
# command usage: sudo apt-get <action> <file or program you want action performed on>
# example:
	$ sudo apt-get install <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get install bluefish

# To remove a program use:
	$ sudo apt-get remove <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get remove bluefish

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To make a 'matrix' style effect on command line use this:

	$ while (true) do echo -n "your message"; done

# To kill task: ctrl z

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To check if a program or specific package is install on your local machine use:

	$ apt-cache policy <name of program>
	$ apt-cache policy python3
	output:
		python3:
			Installed: 3.5.1-3
			Candidate: 3.5.1-3
		Version table:
			*** 3.5.1-3 500
			500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
			100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

# This will tell you if it exists on the machine and where it is installed.

# To check a known non-exsistant program output look like the following:
	$ apt-cache policy bluefish
	output:
		bluefish:
		  Installed: (none)
		  Candidate: 2.2.7-2
		Version table:
		2.2.7-2 500

drwxrwxr-x 2 andre andre  4096 Jun 17 17:44 Command_Line_Notes

In the order of output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.exe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-file permissions (drwxrwxr)
number of links (1)
owner name (root)
owner group (root)
file size (2048)
time of last modification, and
file/directory name (Jan 13 07:11 <name of file/directory>

File permissions is displayed as following:

first character is - or l or d
d-  indicates a directory.
a line(hyphen) represents a file.
l-  is a symlink (or soft link) - special type of file.

three sets of characters, three times, indicating permissions for owner, group and other:
r = readable
w = writable
x = executable

In the example out put above -rwxrw-r--, this means the line displayed is:

a regular file (displayed as -)
readable, writable and executable by owner (rwx)
readable, writable, but not executable by group (rw-)
readable but not writable or executable by other (r--)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



# chown = 'Change ownership' - change to a specific user or 'Root'
command:
	$ chown user:group <name of file/directory> (can also specify a direct path (usr/env<name of file>)

# chmod = 'Change permissions' - allowing what can and can not be done to a specific file or directory.

NOTE**** You can add -R to both chown, and chmod to make the command recursive to all files in a directory.

EXAMPLE:
	chown -R user:group <name of directory>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command syntax[edit]

	$ chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...][3]

Usual implemented options include:

-R recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories
-f force, forge ahead with all objects even if errors occur
-v verbose, show objects processed
If a symbolic link is specified, the target object is affected. File modes directly associated with symbolic links themselves are typically never used.

To view the file mode, the ls or stat commands may be used:

$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh

-rwxr-xr--  1 dgerman  staff  823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh
$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh

754

The r, w, and x specify the read, write, and execute access, respectively. The first character of the ls display denotes the object type;
a hyphen represents a plain file. This script can be read, written to, and executed by the owner, read and executed by other members of the staff group and can also be read by others.

Octal modes[edit]
See also: Octal notation of file system permissions

The chmod numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. 
The three rightmost digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users.
The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special setuid, setgid, and sticky flags.

Numerical permissions

#	Permission	rwx
7	read, write and execute	rwx
6	read and write	rw-
5	read and execute	r-x
4	read only	r--
3	write and execute	-wx
2	write only	-w-
1	execute only	--x
0	none	---
Numeric example[edit]
In order to permit all users who are members of the programmers group to update a file

	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-r--r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
	$ chmod 664 sharedFile
	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
Since the setuid, setgid and sticky bits are not specified, this is equivalent to:

	$ chmod 0664 sharedFile

# Creating New files, directories. Removing and deleting files/directories

Commands:

	$ touch - creates files
EXAMPLE:
	$ touch <nameoffile.extension_type>

	$ touch file.txt file2.txt file3.txt file.py file4.cpp file5.html file6.html
** This creates 6 new files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mkdir(make directory)- creates a new empty directory

cp(copy)- how to copy files to a new location

	$ cp <name of target file> <specific directory path>
	$ cp pythonNotes /Documents/tutorials/python

** WHEN INSIDE OF SPECIFIC DIRECTORY**
rm(remove)- removes files and directories
	$ rm file.txt

To remove all files from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm ./*

To remove all files with a specific file extension use:
	$ rm ./*.<extension_type>
	$ rm ./*.html

** WHEN NOT IN SPECIFIC DIRECTORY **

To remove all file from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm <nameofdirectory>/*
	$ rm Documents/*

To remove the directory use:
	$ rm -rf <nameofdirectory>
	$ rm -rf schoolnotes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To move a file use:
	$ mv filename <destination>
	$ mv file1.txt /Documents/newdir

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIND COMMAND***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# use this to find specific files, file extensions, file sizes, as well as specific directories.

Command:
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"
	
	# you can also specify a specific directory in the search like so
	# This command reads as: 
		find in the /etc directory all file types, ignore case and return all with a .conf extension.
	$ find /etc -type f -iname "*.conf"



$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"

find = command
. = in the current directory
-type f = the type we are searching for is 'f' for file.
-iname = means to ignore case (upper/lower) this will return all
"" = name of specific file or name of specific extension type
* = wild card for searching for ALL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GREP Command***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Use grep to find specific items within a file

Command:
	$ grep <"what you are looking for> <name of file to look in>
	$ grep "function" file1.py

# Search all files within current directory, ignoring case(case insensitive)
	$ grep -i "function" ./*


***USE THIS COMMAND TO SEARCH FOR MOST INSTANCES WITHIN A FILE****
# Search and return with line number where instances of the search string are found.
	$ grep -i -n "config" ./*


# *** YOU CAN ALSO USE GREP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 'FIND' COMMAND***

	# you can run a find command as normal and at the end of the command add the flag -exec(execute)
	# -exec takes the grep command argument
	# at the end of your grep command you need to end the statement with {} +


	# this will search and find and return...
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.php" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} +

		-find in the current directory
		-all file types
		-ignoring case(case insensitive)
		-search all with .php extentions
		THEN
		- Execute grep
		- ignoring case
		- show line numbers
		- return 'config' as search
		- {} + end the execute statement

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Redirect the output of a command to a file by printing and creating a file to add output in.
	- you do this by running the command on the output source
	Example:

1. Why you don't have a root password

While you can create a password for the superuser account allowing you to log in as root with su, it's worth mentioning that this isn't the "Ubuntu" way of doing things. Ubuntu have specifically chosen not to give a root login and password by default for a reason. Instead, a default Ubuntu install will use sudo.

Sudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties. In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given "sudo" permission by default.

Anybody with "sudo" permission may perform something "as a superuser" by pre-pending sudo to their command. For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
You will see this usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web. It's an alternative to doing this.

su
apt-get dist-upgrade
exit

With sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password. If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password. You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user. And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.

Sudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges. With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout. This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.

With sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:

sudo su
... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.

And similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.

However when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command. It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).

Just to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root as described in @Oli's answer, if you specifically want to do things this way instead. I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.

# Some useful commands for providing 'help' within the terminal environment.
1. Use man-pages of (man <command> -- these pages give a great over-view of the command and any additional arguments.
2. Use '--help' (E.g cp --help)-- This provides a quick reference of how a command should be structured. Args within [](square brackets) are optional. Args that are NOT in [] are required.
3. Use 'info' (info <command>) -- Much like the man pages, these provide info in addition to the 'man-pages'.
4. If you know of a command but can't rememeber the exact name, you can search the system. You do this by using the 'apropos' command (E.g apropos cp).

Gzip and bzip2 are functionally equivalent. (There once was a bzip, but it seems to have completely vanished off the face of the world.) Other common compression formats are zip, rar and 7z; these three do both compression and archiving (packing multiple files into one). Here are some typical ratings in terms of speed, availability and typical compression ratio (note that these ratings are somewhat subjective, don't take them as gospel):

decompression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > 7z > rar > bzip2
compression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > bzip2 > 7z > rar
compression ratio (better > worse): 7z > rar, bzip2 > gzip > zip
availability (unix): gzip > bzip2 > zip > 7z > rar
availability (windows): zip > rar > 7z > gzip, bzip2
As you can see, there isn't a clear winner. If you want to rely on programs that are likely to be installed already, use zip on Windows (or if possible, self-extracting archives, as Windows doesn't ship with any of these) and gzip on unix. If you want maximum compression, use 7z.

Rar also has downside that, as far as I know, there is no free software that creates rar archives or that can unpack all rar archives. The other formats have free implementations and no (serious) patent claims.

# Archiving a directory to a file using tar

tar -czvf [destination_name].tar.gz or .tgz(also common) [original dir]
***NOTE: arg 'f' MUST be the LAST ARGUMENT otherwise you will receive an error*****

E.g: tar -czvf jupyternotebookbackup.tar.gz jupyternotebook/
# now ls or ll the .tar.gz file and notice the file size... rather large and not practical for email or sending. In this case we need to compress the file using gzip.

command: gzip [*.tar.gz file]

# In order to view the contents of the tar file run:
tar -tf [*.tar.gz]

How to unzip .tgz file using the terminal
To extract a .tgz file with tar you need to use,

tar -xvzf /path/to/yourfile.tgz
where,

x for extract
v for verbose
z for gnuzip
f for file, should come at last just before file name.

FILE TRANSFER THROUGH SSH USING 1. SCP or 2.SFTP
(Please read the man pages for these)

Both scp and sftp use the ssh port 22 because it is encrypted this is the safe way of file 
transfering. NOTE!!! 'Telnet' is unsecure and should be avoided if possible.


# scp [file...file...file] username@ip_address(:and specify where to put the files)
# (eg below.. transfering test1-4 into CentOS remote server and placing the files into the 
user's home directory.

$ scp test1 test2 test3 test4 user@52.90.15.86:~/

SFTP:

$ sftp username@ip_address

Once logged into remote server you are able to run most linux commands.

# transfers file from the REMOTE SERVER --> LOCAL HOST
# think... put file on LOCAL HOST
$ put file_name

# transfers file from the LOCAL HOST --> REMOTE SERVER
# think... get file from LOCAL HOST
$ get file_name

TO EXIT SFTP:

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD (RED HAT LINUX)

1. Reboot machine 
# At GRUB bootloader
When prompt to select OS press 'e'(for edit mode)

2. Locate the kernel line and navigate to the end of the line.
Add 'rd.break' (Ram Disk break)

3. Continue with bootup by pressing ctrl+x

4. mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd
typed password twice
touch /.autorelabel
exit﻿

######################################################################################

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT/USER PASSWORD (Ubuntu 16.04)

# This was performed and successful on my infoset-ng server (andre@suerte) 
# IP address 10.0.0.100

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

TWO OPTIONS TO CONTINUE:

OPTION 1: Delete everything after 'ro'(sometimes it will say splash screen....) and append the following:

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

# add this:
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root rw init=/bin/bash

Press ctrl+x to continue reboot

You will now be in /bin/bash as root like so:
root@(None):/# 

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

Exit by running:
exit

****************************
OPTION 2:

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

3. Now instead of deleting anything we can just add to at the end like so:

root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro init=/bin/bash

4. Press ctrl+x to continue boot

5. Here is where it differs from OPTION 1
- at the moment we don't have the ability to 'write' on the file system, only 'read'(ro)
- you can verify this by running:
mount 

Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (ro,relatime,data=ordered)

To write to the file system:
mount -o remount,rw / 
this allows us to now read and write to the file system at / (root).

check that you have ability to 'rw'
Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

How can we change root password
Here are a few ways I can think of, from the least intrusive to the most intrusive.

Without Rebooting
With sudo: if you have sudo permissions to run passwd, you can do:

$ sudo passwd root

Enter your password, then enter a new password for root twice. Done.

Editing files: this works in the unlikely case you don't have full sudo access, but you do have access to edit /etc/{passwd,shadow}. Open /etc/shadow, either with sudoedit /etc/shadow, or with sudo $EDITOR /etc/shadow. Replace root's password field (all the random characters between the second and third colons :) with your own user's password field. Save. The local has the same password as you. Log in and change the password to something else.

###############################################################################################

HOW TO LIST ALL USERS ON SYSTEM WITH A HOME DIRECTORY

1. Run as Root
2. # cat /etc/passwd | grep /home*


##############################################################################################

***PRACTICE RHCSA QUESTIONS***

1. Set up an account for a new System Administrator, Jason, who has just joined your team. His full name is Jason Doe, his shell is bash, he is a member of a new group called admin. His user quota at /home is 100Mb.Jason can execute any command as root but has to supply his own password at each request.


1.Run as Root (su -)

2. # create the group admin with a gid(group ID) of 601
command: groupadd -g 601 admin

3. # add the user to group 601, allow shell access in /bin/bash, add a home directory at /home/jason, -c comment full name

command: useradd -g 601 -s /bin/bash -d /home/jason -c "Jason Doe" jason

How to search the linux repository for a specific program name:
# use this command to search for what you think a program is called. 
apt-cache will return similar results to help you determine the exact name of the program you are looking for along with a short description.
# be sure to use a (*) at the end of the program name to include 'all' files 
when searching.

	$ sudo apt-cache search <name of program*>
	$ sudo apt-cache search Django*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To repeat the previous command use:

	$ sudo !!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To switch users use:

	$ su <name of user>
	$ su carolina
	$ su andre

# To change to Root user use:

	# 'Super user do, super user'.
	$ sudo su

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To manage packages/install, remove, update, and upgrade  use the 'apt-get' program
# command usage: sudo apt-get <action> <file or program you want action performed on>
# example:
	$ sudo apt-get install <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get install bluefish

# To remove a program use:
	$ sudo apt-get remove <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get remove bluefish

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To make a 'matrix' style effect on command line use this:

	$ while (true) do echo -n "your message"; done

# To kill task: ctrl z

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To check if a program or specific package is install on your local machine use:

	$ apt-cache policy <name of program>
	$ apt-cache policy python3

file/directory name (Jan 13 07:11 <name of file/directory>

File permissions is displayed as following:

first character is - or l or d
d-  indicates a directory.
a line(hyphen) represents a file.
l-  is a symlink (or soft link) - special type of file.

three sets of characters, three times, indicating permissions for owner, group and other:
r = readable
w = writable
x = executable

In the example out put above -rwxrw-r--, this means the line displayed is:

a regular file (displayed as -)
readable, writable and executable by owner (rwx)
readable, writable, but not executable by group (rw-)
readable but not writable or executable by other (r--)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



# chown = 'Change ownership' - change to a specific user or 'Root'
command:
	$ chown user:group <name of file/directory> (can also specify a direct path (usr/env<name of file>)

# chmod = 'Change permissions' - allowing what can and can not be done to a specific file or directory.

NOTE**** You can add -R to both chown, and chmod to make the command recursive to all files in a directory.

EXAMPLE:
	chown -R user:group <name of directory>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command syntax[edit]

	$ chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...][3]

Usual implemented options include:

-R recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories
-f force, forge ahead with all objects even if errors occur
-v verbose, show objects processed
If a symbolic link is specified, the target object is affected. File modes directly associated with symbolic links themselves are typically never used.

To view the file mode, the ls or stat commands may be used:

$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh

-rwxr-xr--  1 dgerman  staff  823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh
$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh

754

The r, w, and x specify the read, write, and execute access, respectively. The first character of the ls display denotes the object type;
a hyphen represents a plain file. This script can be read, written to, and executed by the owner, read and executed by other members of the staff group and can also be read by others.

Octal modes[edit]
See also: Octal notation of file system permissions

The chmod numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. 
The three rightmost digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users.
The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special setuid, setgid, and sticky flags.

Numerical permissions

#	Permission	rwx
7	read, write and execute	rwx
6	read and write	rw-
5	read and execute	r-x
4	read only	r--
3	write and execute	-wx
2	write only	-w-
1	execute only	--x
0	none	---
Numeric example[edit]
In order to permit all users who are members of the programmers group to update a file

	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-r--r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
	$ chmod 664 sharedFile
	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
Since the setuid, setgid and sticky bits are not specified, this is equivalent to:

	$ chmod 0664 sharedFile

FIND COMMAND***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# use this to find specific files, file extensions, file sizes, as well as specific directories.

Command:
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"
	
	# you can also specify a specific directory in the search like so
	# This command reads as: 
		find in the /etc directory all file types, ignore case and return all with a .conf extension.
	$ find /etc -type f -iname "*.conf"



$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"

find = command
. = in the current directory
-type f = the type we are searching for is 'f' for file.
-iname = means to ignore case (upper/lower) this will return all
"" = name of specific file or name of specific extension type
* = wild card for searching for ALL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GREP Command***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Use grep to find specific items within a file

Command:
	$ grep <"what you are looking for> <name of file to look in>
	$ grep "function" file1.py

# Search all files within current directory, ignoring case(case insensitive)
	$ grep -i "function" ./*


***USE THIS COMMAND TO SEARCH FOR MOST INSTANCES WITHIN A FILE****
# Search and return with line number where instances of the search string are found.
	$ grep -i -n "config" ./*


# *** YOU CAN ALSO USE GREP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 'FIND' COMMAND***

	# you can run a find command as normal and at the end of the command add the flag -exec(execute)
	# -exec takes the grep command argument
	# at the end of your grep command you need to end the statement with {} +


	# this will search and find and return...
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.php" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} +

		-find in the current directory
		-all file types
		-ignoring case(case insensitive)
		-search all with .php extentions
		THEN
		- Execute grep
		- ignoring case
		- show line numbers
		- return 'config' as search
		- {} + end the execute statement

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Redirect the output of a command to a file by printing and creating a file to add output in.
	- you do this by running the command on the output source
	Example:
		$ find . -type f -size -20k -iname "*.py" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} + | tee drelog.txt

	# This searches the current directory looking for files less than 20 kilobytes with the .py extention. 
	# Then executes grep case insensitive, displaying line numbers searching for string 'config' 
	# Then it pipes the result into a file named 'drelog.txt' as well as prints the output to the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# PROCESSES

# Use 'top' or 'htop' to view in real-time current processes.

# To view all background tasks use the command:
	$ ps aux

# To view a specific app or program use ps aux and pipe the app or program as the argument.
	$ ps aux | python3

# To view processor ID's (PID) use the command pgrep.
	$ pgrep chrome

# To kill a single app or process use grep to return the proccessor id and then kill it based on it's id.
	$ pgrep chrome
		output:
		1568
		3369
		1497
		7812
	# To kill a specific process use this command.
		$ kill -9 1497

# Likewise to kill all of the proccesses use:
	$ killall chrome

1. Use man-pages of (man <command> -- these pages give a great over-view of the command and any additional arguments.
2. Use '--help' (E.g cp --help)-- This provides a quick reference of how a command should be structured. Args within [](square brackets) are optional. Args that are NOT in [] are required.
3. Use 'info' (info <command>) -- Much like the man pages, these provide info in addition to the 'man-pages'.
4. If you know of a command but can't rememeber the exact name, you can search the system. You do this by using the 'apropos' command (E.g apropos cp).

Gzip and bzip2 are functionally equivalent. (There once was a bzip, but it seems to have completely vanished off the face of the world.) Other common compression formats are zip, rar and 7z; these three do both compression and archiving (packing multiple files into one). Here are some typical ratings in terms of speed, availability and typical compression ratio (note that these ratings are somewhat subjective, don't take them as gospel):

decompression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > 7z > rar > bzip2
compression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > bzip2 > 7z > rar
compression ratio (better > worse): 7z > rar, bzip2 > gzip > zip
availability (unix): gzip > bzip2 > zip > 7z > rar
availability (windows): zip > rar > 7z > gzip, bzip2
As you can see, there isn't a clear winner. If you want to rely on programs that are likely to be installed already, use zip on Windows (or if possible, self-extracting archives, as Windows doesn't ship with any of these) and gzip on unix. If you want maximum compression, use 7z.

Rar also has downside that, as far as I know, there is no free software that creates rar archives or that can unpack all rar archives. The other formats have free implementations and no (serious) patent claims.

# Archiving a directory to a file using tar

tar -czvf [destination_name].tar.gz or .tgz(also common) [original dir]
***NOTE: arg 'f' MUST be the LAST ARGUMENT otherwise you will receive an error*****

E.g: tar -czvf jupyternotebookbackup.tar.gz jupyternotebook/
# now ls or ll the .tar.gz file and notice the file size... rather large and not practical for email or sending. In this case we need to compress the file using gzip.

command: gzip [*.tar.gz file]

# In order to view the contents of the tar file run:
tar -tf [*.tar.gz]

How to unzip .tgz file using the terminal
To extract a .tgz file with tar you need to use,

tar -xvzf /path/to/yourfile.tgz
where,

x for extract
v for verbose
z for gnuzip
f for file, should come at last just before file name.

What does this do?

cat [file] > [newfile].txt 

This is output redirection into a new file. This creates the file if it does not exist and writes the output to the file. *NOTE: If the file already exists then this will overwrite the file.

#############################################################################################

What does this command do?

$ ps aux >> processfile.txt

This creates process.txt if it doesn't exist and/or appends the output of ps aux into the file process.txt

How do you redirect a STDERR output to a log file?

you do this by using the 2> (2 and a greater than sign)

$ [some_bad_command] 2> logfile.txt

again this creates the file if it doesn't exist.  However,  if the file does exist then you will need to use:
 $ [some_bad_command] 2>> logfile.txt
 to append the stderr output.

FILE TRANSFER THROUGH SSH USING 1. SCP or 2.SFTP
(Please read the man pages for these)

Both scp and sftp use the ssh port 22 because it is encrypted this is the safe way of file 
transfering. NOTE!!! 'Telnet' is unsecure and should be avoided if possible.


# scp [file...file...file] username@ip_address(:and specify where to put the files)
# (eg below.. transfering test1-4 into CentOS remote server and placing the files into the 
user's home directory.

$ scp test1 test2 test3 test4 user@52.90.15.86:~/

SFTP:

$ sftp username@ip_address

Once logged into remote server you are able to run most linux commands.

# transfers file from the REMOTE SERVER --> LOCAL HOST
# think... put file on LOCAL HOST
$ put file_name

# transfers file from the LOCAL HOST --> REMOTE SERVER
# think... get file from LOCAL HOST
$ get file_name

TO EXIT SFTP:
type: 'bye, exit or quit'

ls [0-10][0-10]NameOfTheFile


****COMMANDS TO KNOW****

$ service --status-all  

runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with the status command.   The  status
is  [ + ] for running services, [ - ] for stopped services and [ ? ] for services without a 'status' 
command. This option only calls status for sysvinit jobs; upstart jobs can be queried in a  similar  manner
with initctl list.


$ initctl list

allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart init(8) daemon.

$ dmesg

is used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer.

The default action is to display all messages from the kernel ring buffer.

$ host

is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used
to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or
options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line
arguments and options.


$ dig

(domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS
name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are
returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS
administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its
flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to
have less functionality than dig.

$ systemctl

may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd"
system and service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction
into the basic concepts and functionality this tool manages.

# to start a service run:
$ sytemctl start [service_name]

$ systemd 

systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When
run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that
brings up and maintains userspace services.
For compatibility with SysV, if systemd is called as init and a PID that
is not 1, it will execute telinit and pass all command line arguments
unmodified. That means init and telinit are mostly equivalent when invoked
from normal login sessions. See telinit(8) for more information.

When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user
instance, systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and the
files in user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more
information.

$ pgrep  

pgrep  looks  through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection
criteria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example,

$ pgrep -u root sshd

 will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand,

$ pgrep -u root,daemon

will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.

pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on std‐
 # This will look through the current running processes and search for 'httpd' pass the -l flag to list the name
$ pgrep httpd -l

# search all processes NOT owned by the root user. -v in this case returns the inverse. This is an inverse relationship.
$ pgrep -v -u root -l


Pkill

 pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on std‐ out.


# to kill all processes on a particular service run:
																		$ pkill [name_of_service] (e.g httpd) -- This will kill any services associated with httpd, rather than using kill [PID #]


																		# (below) running kill -l will list out all of the different process kill options
																		# by default pkill if run with no args will default to 15(SIGTERM)-- this will kill the process cleanly and correctly allowing the process to finish tasks before closing.

2) SIGINT--'Signal Interrupt' : This is equalvent to the keyboard input of 'ctrl+c' this kills the process by interruption.

3) SIGQUIT--'Signal Quit': Sends a signal to process causing it to quit. This allows the process to finish any closing tasks if needed.

15) SIGTERM--'Signal Terminate': (Pkill default) this will kill the process cleanly and correctly allowing the process to finish tasks before closing.

18) SIGCONT--'Signal Continue': Will stop a process and then restart it automatically

19) SIGSTOP--'Signal Stop': This forces a STOP to the process and allows the user to restart if needed.

20) SIGTSTP-- Sends a signal to a process that can be stopped but does not forcefully do it.

***HOW TO CLEANLY BOOT ANOTHER USER OFF THE SYSTEM***

AS ROOT: To view all user accounts on system run:


# in /etc/passwd file cut everything in the first column at the delimeter ':'
$ cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

# In order for this to work have a admin user on a physical machine as root. Add another user to the system with their own unique password

$ useradd archie
$ passwd archie
create password

On the root account, ssh into <user>@<server_ip> (e.g ssh archie@10.0.0.5)

Now, as archie sign-in and open vim. This will create the process when we look at the account using:


w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

SYNOPSIS
       w [options] user [...]

DESCRIPTION
       w  displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes.  The header shows,
       in this order, the current time, how long the system has been  running,  how  many  users  are  currently
       logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

       The following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the tty name, the remote host, login time,
       idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command line of their current process.

       The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.  It does not include past background
       jobs, but does include currently running background jobs.

       The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what" field.

TO KILL A PROCESS ON ANOTHER USER

$ pkill -t <terminal_window_id> (pts/*) -- find the particular user's tty and pkill it

Now, this will kill whatever application or process they are using instantly, however this will NOT log the user out.

***In order to completely and cleanly boot the user use the following:***

# first check on their processes and list them.

$ pgrep -u <user_name> -l (e.g pgrep -u frank -l)


# if the user is remoted into the server through ssh, simply kill sshd and this will kill the connection
# Remember to specify -u or else this will kill all sshd processes including any you as the ADMIN are using.

$ pkill -u <user_name> sshd

Here we are going to create a while loop that will print a string of text("My Program") continuously every 1 second and send to a file called output.file in the home directory. The '&' at the end sends this process into a background task.

--To view background tasks run:
$ jobs

(while true; do echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1; done) &

EXAMPLE WITH BACKGROUND RUNNING TASK: 

[andre@centos ~]$ (while true; do echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1; done) &

[andre@centos ~]$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 ( while true; do
    echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1;
done ) &


STOPPING THE PROCESS:

# Notice that the job id = [1]+, in order to pass the job id to -sigstop you must pass %(job_id_#) in this case 1 because there is only one job running.

[andre@centos ~]$ kill -sigstop %1

[1]+  Stopped                 ( while true; do
    echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1;
done )


STARTING A STOPPED PROCESS: Use -sigcont

[andre@centos ~]$ kill -sigcont %1

Nice priority: (Range = negative 20 to positive 19)

-20 = Highest priority
19 = Lowest priority

Any user can make a task lower priority
Only Root can make a task higher priority

EXAMPLES OF CHANGING PRIORITY:


# List all processor tasks, filter by pid(processor id), comm(command), and nice(nice level/priority) search for httpd
# as you see all the httpd tasks have a TOP priority of 0(zero).

[andre@centos ~]$ ps axo pid,comm,nice | grep httpd

 2007 httpd             0
 2009 httpd             0
 2010 httpd             0
 2011 httpd             0
 2012 httpd             0
 2013 httpd             0

# to change the nice level:

# this will change the level to priority 10.
$ nice -n 10 httpd

HOW TO CHANGE THE PRIORITY LEVEL ON A RUNNING SERVICE WITHOUT STOPPING IT?
FOR EXAMPLE A WEB SERVER...STOPPING IT WOULD BOOT ALL USERS LOGGED IN...THIS WOULD BE BAD.

# to change for a single process use:
$ renice -n [new_level] [pid] ---> renice -n 10 2011


HOW TO CHANGE NICE LEVEL RECURRSIVLY FOR ALL HTTPD PROCESSES.
-- In this case we need to use what's called a 'sub shell' this is identified by $()

# to change the level for all httpd processes

$ renice -n [new_level] $(pgrep [service_name/process]) ------> E.g $ renice -n 10 $(pgrep httpd)

So what is happening? The sub-shell is run first giving us all of our httpd processes. That output is then passed to renice which makes the change.

###############################################################################################################################

renice +4 $(pgrep firefox)
Make all firefox processes run nicer by a value of 4. This command illustrates the way pgrep's output can be passed to other utilities as input. In this case, the command pgrep firefox is passed as an argument to renice because it is enclosed in $( ).

GET CPU INFO 

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo

The proc file system is a pseudo-file system which is used as an interface to kernel data structures.  It
is commonly mounted at /proc.  Most of it is read-only, but some  files  allow  kernel  variables  to  be
changed.


# get the number of processors specific to the machine

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | wc -l

View the system uptime and load average.

[root@localhost ~]# uptime

user  pts/1     09:18    1.00s  0.10s  5.32s /usr/libexec/gnome-terminal-server
3. Using the proc file system and wc, display the number of processors your system has. This is important to calculate the load average of the system.

[root@localhost]# grep "model name" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
4. Calculate the 1, 5, and 15 minute CPU load averages for the system.

There are two processes as a result of our previous command.

[root@localhost ~]# grep "model name" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l

# man systemd-journald

  systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains
       structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources:

       ·   Kernel log messages, via kmsg

       ·   Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call

       ·   Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see sd_journal_print(4)

       ·   Standard output and standard error of system services

       ·   Audit records, via the audit subsystem

       The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each log messages in a secure and
       unfakeable way. See systemd.journal-fields(7) for more information about the collected metadata.

       Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can also include binary data where
       necessary. All objects stored in the journal can be up to 2^64-1 bytes in size.

       By default, the journal stores log data in /run/log/journal/. Since /run/ is volatile, log data is lost
       at reboot. To make the data persistent, it is sufficient to create /var/log/journal/ where
       systemd-journald will then store the data.

       systemd-journald will forward all received log messages to the AF_UNIX/SOCK_DGRAM socket
       /run/systemd/journal/syslog, if it exists, which may be used by Unix syslog daemons to process the data
       further.

       See journald.conf(5) for information about the configuration of this service.

***The directory /run/log is essentially a temp file system unique to each boot up***

#############################################################################

CREATING A NEW MBR(MASTER BOOT RECORD) PARTITION

fdisk---> manipulate disk partition table
	  fdisk  (in  the  first  form of invocation) is a menu-driven program for creation and
       manipulation of partition tables.  It understands GPT (experimental  for  now),  MBR,
       Sun, SGI and BSD partition tables.

       fdisk  does  not  use  DOS-compatible mode and cylinders as display units by default.
       The old deprecated DOS behavior can be enabled with the  '-c=dos  -u=cylinders'  com‐
       mand-line options.

       Hard  disks  can  be  divided into one or more logical disks called partitions.  This
       division is recorded in the partition table, found in sector 0 of the disk.  (In  the
       BSD world one talks about `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)

fdisk usage for creating a partition:

MAKE THE FILE SYSTEM TO MOUNT

Now we created the partiton above using the fdisk command but what do we do with the partition? We must a filesystem in order the mount it.



XFS(Extend File system) is a default root filesystem in Redhat Linux ES 7 onwards. This shows redhat has plan to shift from ext filesystems. XFS filesystem is originally developed by  Silicon Graphics. XFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file system compare to ext4 and it supports up to 16 exabytes filesystem and 8 exabytes files.  XFS supports metadata journaling, which facilitates quicker crash recovery on the power failures and system crash.It can also be defragmented and extended while mounted and active.It also supports quota. 

# makes a file system with file system type 'xfs'
$ mkfs -t xfs xvdf1

mkfs  is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device, usually a hard disk partition.
       The device argument is either the device name (e.g.  /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a reg‐
       ular  file  that  shall  contain  the filesystem.  The size argument is the number of
       blocks to be used for the filesystem.

Swap:         3046          0       3046
8. Add swap space to the /etc/fstab so that it is a persistent mount.

[root@localhost dev]# blkid

UUID=YOUR-UUID swap  swap    defaults 0 0 
9. Activate the swap space that is added in the /etc/fstab file.

Since we activated it manually already, this manually deactivates it, then activates it based on the /etc/fstab file.

[root@localhost dev]# swapoff /dev/xvdf1

lsblk command – list block device information
*************************************************

BY RASHO · 21/09/2014

lsblk command is used to list information about all available block devices, however, it does not list information about RAM disks. Examples of block devices are hard disk, flash drives, CD-ROM…

Install lsblk
Ubuntu and Linux Mint installation
The command lsblk comes in the package util-linux.

sudo apt-get install util-linux -y
Fedora and CentOS installation

sudo yum install util-linux-ng
How to use lsblk command
lsblk command by default will list all block devices in a tree-like format.
Example: Type lsblk in your terminal:

rasho@Gandalf ~ $ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 465,8G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part 
├─sda2   8:2    0    80G  0 part 
├─sda3   8:3    0 297,9G  0 part 
├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part 
├─sda5   8:5    0    28G  0 part /
├─sda6   8:6    0   3,7G  0 part [SWAP]
└─sda7   8:7    0  56,2G  0 part /home
sr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom
There are seven columns namely:
NAME: This is the device name.
MAJ:MIN: This column shows the major and minor device number.
RM: This column shows whether the device is removable or not.
SIZE: This is column give information on the size of the device.
RO: This indicates whether a device is read-only.
TYPE:This column shows information whether the block device is a disk or a partition(part) within a disk.
MOUNTPOINT: This column indicates mount point on which the device is mounted.

 
List all devices
To show list all devices including empty devices use following command:

lsblk -a
Example output:

rasho@Gandalf ~ $ lsblk -a
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 465,8G  0 disk

├─sda3   8:3    0 319815680000  0 part 
├─sda4   8:4    0         1024  0 part 
├─sda5   8:5    0  29998710784  0 part /
├─sda6   8:6    0   3999268864  0 part [SWAP]
└─sda7   8:7    0  60298362880  0 part /home
sr0     11:0    1   1073741312  0 rom
Hide the information related to slaves
If you do not want to display slave related information, use the -d option.

rasho@Gandalf ~ $ lsblk -d
NAME MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    8:0    0 465,8G  0 disk 
sr0   11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  
So you can see that the information related to slaves is not displayed in the output.

Create, Mount, Unmount and Use VFAT, EXT4 and XFS File Systems

********************************************************************************

What is the difference between VFAT and FAT32 file systems
Copied from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750354.aspx

What's FAT?
FAT may sound like a strange name for a file system, but it's actually an acronym for File Allocation Table. Introduced in 1981, FAT is ancient in computer terms. Because of its age, most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows NT®, Windows 98, the Macintosh OS, and some versions of UNIX, offer support for FAT.

The FAT file system limits filenames to the 8.3 naming convention, meaning that a filename can have no more than eight characters before the period and no more than three after. Filenames in a FAT file system must also begin with a letter or number, and they can't contain spaces. Filenames aren't case sensitive.

What About VFAT?
Perhaps you've also heard of a file system called VFAT. VFAT is an extension of the FAT file system and was introduced with Windows 95. VFAT maintains backward compatibility with FAT but relaxes the rules. For example, VFAT filenames can contain up to 255 characters, spaces, and multiple periods. Although VFAT preserves the case of filenames, it's not considered case sensitive.

When you create a long filename (longer than 8.3) with VFAT, the file system actually creates two different filenames. One is the actual long filename. This name is visible to Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT (4.0 and later). The second filename is called an MS-DOS® alias. An MS-DOS alias is an abbreviated form of the long filename. The file system creates the MS-DOS alias by taking the first six characters of the long filename (not counting spaces), followed by the tilde [~] and a numeric trailer. For example, the filename Brien's Document.txt would have an alias of BRIEN'~1.txt.

An interesting side effect results from the way VFAT stores its long filenames. When you create a long filename with VFAT, it uses one directory entry for the MS-DOS alias and another entry for every 13 characters of the long filename. In theory, a single long filename could occupy up to 21 directory entries. The root directory has a limit of 512 files, but if you were to use the maximum length long filenames in the root directory, you could cut this limit to a mere 24 files. Therefore, you should use long filenames very sparingly in the root directory. Other directories aren't affected by this limit.

You may be wondering why we're discussing VFAT. The reason is it's becoming more common than FAT, but aside from the differences I mentioned above, VFAT has the same limitations. When you tell Windows NT to format a partition as FAT, it actually formats the partition as VFAT. The only time you'll have a true FAT partition under Windows NT 4.0 is when you use another operating system, such as MS-DOS, to format the partition.

# TO CREATE A SHARED FILE SYSTEM TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS USER USE A 'VFAT' FILESYTEM THEN USE 'SAMBA' TO CONNECT OVER THE NETWORK. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)

FAT32
FAT32 is actually an extension of FAT and VFAT, first introduced with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). FAT32 greatly enhances the VFAT file system but it does have its drawbacks.

The greatest advantage to FAT32 is that it dramatically increases the amount of free hard disk space. To illustrate this point, consider that a FAT partition (also known as a FAT16 partition) allows only a certain number of clusters per partition. Therefore, as your partition size increases, the cluster size must also increase. For example, a 512-MB FAT partition has a cluster size of 8K, while a 2-GB partition has a cluster size of 32K.

This may not sound like a big deal until you consider that the FAT file system only works in single cluster increments. For example, on a 2-GB partition, a 1-byte file will occupy the entire cluster, thereby consuming 32K, or roughly 32,000 times the amount of space that the file should consume. This rule applies to every file on your hard disk, so you can see how much space can be wasted.

Converting a partition to FAT32 reduces the cluster size (and overcomes the 2-GB partition size limit). For partitions 8 GB and smaller, the cluster size is reduced to a mere 4K. As you can imagine, it's not uncommon to gain back hundreds of megabytes by converting a partition to FAT32, especially if the partition contains a lot of small files.

Note: This section of the quote/ article (1999) is out of date. Updated info quote below.

As I mentioned, FAT32 does have limitations. Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with any operating system other than Windows 98 and the OSR2 version of Windows 95. However, Windows 2000 will be able to read FAT32 partitions.

The other disadvantage is that your disk utilities and antivirus software must be FAT32-aware. Otherwise, they could interpret the new file structure as an error and try to correct it, thus destroying data in the process.

Finally, I should mention that converting to FAT32 is a one-way process. Once you've converted to FAT32, you can't convert the partition back to FAT16. Therefore, before converting to FAT32, you need to consider whether the computer will ever be used in a dual-boot environment. I should also point out that although other operating systems such as Windows NT can't directly read a FAT32 partition, they can read it across the network. Therefore, it's no problem to share information stored on a FAT32 partition with other computers on a network that run older operating systems.

Updated mentioned in comment by Doktor-J (assimilated to update out of date answer in case comment is ever lost):

I'd just like to point out that most modern operating systems (WinXP/Vista/7/8, MacOS X, most if not all Linux variants) can read FAT32, contrary to what the second-to-last paragraph suggests.

The original article was written in 1999, and being posted on a Microsoft website, probably wasn't concerned with non-Microsoft operating systems anyways.

The operating systems "excluded" by that paragraph are probably the original Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 3.1, DOS, etc.


What is EXT4 filesystem?

Bigger File System and File Sizes
Currently, Ext3 support 16 TiB of maximum file system size and 2 TiB of maximum file size. Ext4 adds 48-bit block addressing, so it will have 1 EiB1 of maximum file system size and 16 TiB of maximum file size.

# CREATING A 'XFS' FILESYSTEM

# WHY XFS?
  --> XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system

Capacity
XFS is a 64-bit file system[20] and supports a maximum file system size of 8 exbibytes minus one byte (263 − 1 bytes), but limitations imposed by the host operating system can decrease this limit. 32-bit Linux systems limit the size of both the file and file system to 16 tebibytes.

XFS excels in the execution of parallel input/output (I/O) operations due to its design, which is based on allocation groups (a type of subdivision of the physical volumes in which XFS is used- also shortened to AGs). Because of this, XFS enables extreme scalability of I/O threads, file system bandwidth, and size of files and of the file system itself when spanning multiple physical storage devices.

XFS ensures the consistency of data by employing metadata journaling and supporting write barriers. Space allocation is performed via extents with data structures stored in B+ trees, improving the overall performance of the file system, especially when handling large files. Delayed allocation assists in the prevention of file system fragmentation; online defragmentation is also supported. A feature unique to XFS is the pre-allocation of I/O bandwidth at a pre-determined rate; this is suitable for many real-time applications. However, this feature was supported only on IRIX, and only with specialized hardware.

A notable XFS user, NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division, takes advantage of these capabilities deploying two 300+ terabyte XFS filesystems on two SGI Altix archival storage servers, each of which is directly attached to multiple Fibre Channel disk arrays.

# HOW TO REPAIR, CHECK AND ENSURE CONSISTENCY ON 'XFS' TYPE FILESYSTEM

COMMANDS TO USE:

1. xfs_info [/dev/devicename*]
2. xfs_admin -L [device_label_name] [/dev/devicename*] ----> Names the 'xfs' filesystem device
3. xfs_repair [/dev/devicename*]

You should find your device UUID in /dev/disk/by-uuid:

example: using uuid
xfs_repair /dev/disk/by-uuid/198s5364-a29c-429e-b16d-e772acd

# how to find uuid locations
There is findfs to translate UUID to device names.

example:
# findfs UUID=01d91a31-d25c-48ea-a10f-6166ce0f5964
/dev/mapper/SSD-archlinux

RESTART SSH SERVICE

sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart



# Using globs in Linux Red Hat

ls nameOfTheFile* - 
ls ?nameOfTheFile
ls [nam]meOfTheFile
ls [!te]meOfTheFile --> Negates(excludes) characters after '!' Can also be '^'(e.g [^na]meOfTheFile)
ls [0-10][0-10]NameOfTheFile


****COMMANDS TO KNOW****

$ service --status-all  

runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with the status command.   The  status
is  [ + ] for running services, [ - ] for stopped services and [ ? ] for services without a 'status' 
command. This option only calls status for sysvinit jobs; upstart jobs can be queried in a  similar  manner
with initctl list.


$ initctl list

allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart init(8) daemon.

$ dmesg

is used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer.

The default action is to display all messages from the kernel ring buffer.

$ host

is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used
to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or
options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line
arguments and options.


$ dig

(domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS
name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are
returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS
administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its
flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to
have less functionality than dig.

$ systemctl

may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd"
system and service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction
into the basic concepts and functionality this tool manages.

# to start a service run:
$ sytemctl start [service_name]

$ systemd 

systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When
run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that
brings up and maintains userspace services.
For compatibility with SysV, if systemd is called as init and a PID that
is not 1, it will execute telinit and pass all command line arguments
unmodified. That means init and telinit are mostly equivalent when invoked
from normal login sessions. See telinit(8) for more information.

When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user
instance, systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and the
files in user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more
information.

$ pgrep  

pgrep  looks  through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection
criteria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example,

$ pgrep -u root sshd

 will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand,

$ pgrep -u root,daemon

will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.

pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on std‐
 # This will look through the current running processes and search for 'httpd' pass the -l flag to list the name
$ pgrep httpd -l

# search all processes NOT owned by the root user. -v in this case returns the inverse. This is an inverse relationship.
$ pgrep -v -u root -l


Pkill

 pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on std‐ out.


# to kill all processes on a particular service run:
																		$ pkill [name_of_service] (e.g httpd) -- This will kill any services associated with httpd, rather than using kill [PID #]


																		# (below) running kill -l will list out all of the different process kill options
																		# by default pkill if run with no args will default to 15(SIGTERM)-- this will kill the process cleanly and correctly allowing the process to finish tasks before closing.
																		# NOTE if we encounter a process that is hung/frozen or a prossible malious attack use 9(SIGKILL) to immediately terminate the process.

																		  2) SIGINT--'Signal Interrupt' : This is equalvent to the keyboard input of 'ctrl+c' this kills the process by interruption.

3) SIGQUIT--'Signal Quit': Sends a signal to process causing it to quit. This allows the process to finish any closing tasks if needed.

15) SIGTERM--'Signal Terminate': (Pkill default) this will kill the process cleanly and correctly allowing the process to finish tasks before closing.

18) SIGCONT--'Signal Continue': Will stop a process and then restart it automatically

19) SIGSTOP--'Signal Stop': This forces a STOP to the process and allows the user to restart if needed.

20) SIGTSTP-- Sends a signal to a process that can be stopped but does not forcefully do it.

***HOW TO CLEANLY BOOT ANOTHER USER OFF THE SYSTEM***

AS ROOT: To view all user accounts on system run:


# in /etc/passwd file cut everything in the first column at the delimeter ':'
$ cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

# In order for this to work have a admin user on a physical machine as root. Add another user to the system with their own unique password

$ useradd archie
$ passwd archie
create password

On the root account, ssh into <user>@<server_ip> (e.g ssh archie@10.0.0.5)

Now, as archie sign-in and open vim. This will create the process when we look at the account using:


w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

SYNOPSIS
       w [options] user [...]

DESCRIPTION
       w  displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes.  The header shows,
       in this order, the current time, how long the system has been  running,  how  many  users  are  currently
       logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

       The following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the tty name, the remote host, login time,
       idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command line of their current process.

       The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.  It does not include past background
       jobs, but does include currently running background jobs.

       The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what" field.

TO KILL A PROCESS ON ANOTHER USER

$ pkill -t <terminal_window_id> (pts/*) -- find the particular user's tty and pkill it

Now, this will kill whatever application or process they are using instantly, however this will NOT log the user out.

***In order to completely and cleanly boot the user use the following:***

# first check on their processes and list them.

$ pgrep -u <user_name> -l (e.g pgrep -u frank -l)


# if the user is remoted into the server through ssh, simply kill sshd and this will kill the connection
# Remember to specify -u or else this will kill all sshd processes including any you as the ADMIN are using.

$ pkill -u <user_name> sshd

Here we are going to create a while loop that will print a string of text("My Program") continuously every 1 second and send to a file called output.file in the home directory. The '&' at the end sends this process into a background task.

--To view background tasks run:
$ jobs

(while true; do echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1; done) &

EXAMPLE WITH BACKGROUND RUNNING TASK: 

[andre@centos ~]$ (while true; do echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1; done) &
[1] 31266
[andre@centos ~]$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 ( while true; do
    echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1;
done ) &


STOPPING THE PROCESS:

# Notice that the job id = [1]+, in order to pass the job id to -sigstop you must pass %(job_id_#) in this case 1 because there is only one job running.

[andre@centos ~]$ kill -sigstop %1

[1]+  Stopped                 ( while true; do
    echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1;
done )


STARTING A STOPPED PROCESS: Use -sigcont

[andre@centos ~]$ kill -sigcont %1
[andre@centos ~]$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 ( while true; do
    echo -n "My Program" >> ~/output.file; sleep 1;
done ) &

Nice priority: (Range = negative 20 - positive 19)

-20 = Highest priority
19 = Lowest priority

Any user can make a task lower priority
Only Root can make a task higher priority

EXAMPLES OF CHANGING PRIORITY:


# List all processor tasks, filter by pid(processor id), comm(command), and nice(nice level/priority) search for httpd
# as you see all the httpd tasks have a TOP priority of 0(zero).

[andre@centos ~]$ ps axo pid,comm,nice | grep httpd

 2007 httpd             0
 2009 httpd             0
 2010 httpd             0
 2011 httpd             0
 2012 httpd             0
 2013 httpd             0

# to change the nice level:

# this will change the level to priority 10.
$ nice -n 10 httpd

HOW TO CHANGE THE PRIORITY LEVEL ON A RUNNING SERVICE WITHOUT STOPPING IT?
FOR EXAMPLE A WEB SERVER...STOPPING IT WOULD BOOT ALL USERS LOGGED IN...THIS WOULD BE BAD.

# to change for a single process use:
$ renice -n [new_level] [pid] ---> renice -n 10 2011


HOW TO CHANGE NICE LEVEL RECURRSIVLY FOR ALL HTTPD PROCESSES.
-- In this case we need to use what's called a 'sub shell' this is identified by $()

# to change the level for all httpd processes

$ renice -n [new_level] $(pgrep [service_name/process]) ------> E.g $ renice -n 10 $(pgrep httpd)

So what is happening? The sub-shell is run first giving us all of our httpd processes. That output is then passed to renice which makes the change.

[root@centos andre]# ps axo pid,comm,nice | grep httpd

# man systemd-journald

  systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains
       structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources:

       ·   Kernel log messages, via kmsg

       ·   Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call

       ·   Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see sd_journal_print(4)

       ·   Standard output and standard error of system services

       ·   Audit records, via the audit subsystem

       The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each log messages in a secure and
       unfakeable way. See systemd.journal-fields(7) for more information about the collected metadata.

       Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can also include binary data where
       necessary. All objects stored in the journal can be up to 2^64-1 bytes in size.

       By default, the journal stores log data in /run/log/journal/. Since /run/ is volatile, log data is lost
       at reboot. To make the data persistent, it is sufficient to create /var/log/journal/ where
       systemd-journald will then store the data.

       systemd-journald will forward all received log messages to the AF_UNIX/SOCK_DGRAM socket
       /run/systemd/journal/syslog, if it exists, which may be used by Unix syslog daemons to process the data
       further.

       See journald.conf(5) for information about the configuration of this service.

***The directory /run/log is essentially a temp file system unique to each boot up***

What is the first digit in umask value?

The first digit 0 is not in use in your example. The umask reads from right to left and trailing zeros are ignored. It can however be used to set special permissions, such as sticky bit, Set GUID, Set UID as shown below.

0755  —- None of the special bits set
1755  —- Sticky bit set
2755  —- SGID bit set
4755  —- SUID bit set
You are correct that a umask of 0022 the will mask a default 777 (directory) permission to become 755 on newly created directories.

The octal numbering works similar to the first three sets: user, group, world/other.

The read/write/execute rwx values are represented in octal form with the corresponding values which can total a maximum of 7:

4 - Read 
2 - Write 
1 - Execute
So for 0755: 0 is ignored. 7 (4+2+1) equals read, write, and execute for the user/owner. And 5 (4+1) equals read and execute for the group, and the remaining 5 (also 4+1) gives read and execute permissions to other/world.


UNDERSTANDING UMASK

umask default can be seen using the command:

$ umask

umask default permissions on files == 666 (rw- User:Group:Other)
umask default permissions of directories == 777 (rwx-- User:Group:other)

What is DHCP?

Anyone with a basic knowledge of computer networking knows that for two hosts to communicate on the same network using TCP/IP model, both hosts need to have a unique IP address. There are two ways on how any given host on your network can obtain an IP address. 

One way is to manually configure the network interface and assign an IP address by hand. The manual network configuration is called static configuration, which means that host's IP address does not change its IP address unless changed manually by the user or system administrator. If your company network includes more than 1000 hosts, the job of configuring each host with a static IP address becomes tiresome and more importantly extremely inefficient. 

Another way to assign your network hosts with a proper IP address regardless of the actual network size is to assign an IP address to each host automatically. To perform an automatic host's IP configuration is where DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ) comes handy. 

The DHCP protocol lets a DHCP client, that is your network host to lease network configuration parameters such as an IP address. In fact, lease parameters are not limited to IP address only as they may also include the following configuration settings:

IP addresses and network masks
Domain Names servers ( DNS )
Default Gateways
WINS servers
Syslog hosts
Proxy servers
NTP servers
X Font servers
Syslog hosts
Each network host configured to obtain an IP address dynamically via DHCP will upon boot send a DHCP request over the network ( by definition this is a broadcast of all 1's ) to discover whether there is a DHCP server available somewhere on the network and consequently ask for a network configuration. DHCP client is then obligated to maintain communication with DHCP server and renew its IP address regularly as dictated by IP address's lease time expiry. In case that DHCP client fails to renew its IP address ( disconnection, a host is turned off, etc. ) its IP address expires and DHCP server is free to lease this IP address to another DHCP client.

DHCP server keeps a record of all leased IP addresses and stores them in a file called dhcpd.leases within /var/lib/dhcp directory ( location of this file may vary depending on Linux system in use ). Having such a file allows DHCP server to keep track of all IP address leases even after the reboot or power failure. 

Here are some advantages of having a DHCP server connected to network:

No IP address conflicts. DHCP can guarantee that all hosts on the network have a unique IP address. DHCP server keeps a record of all IP addresses assigned and cross reference them with host's MAC addresses.
Based on the MAC address, DHCP allows for a fixed parameter configuration for a specific host
minimum local client network configuration, hence Increased efficiency.

# NTP (Network Time Protocol)

Network Time Protocol (NTP) 
is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).[1]:3 It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.[2][3]

The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source.[1]:20 Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.[4][5] They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange.[3] NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.[2][3]

The current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is a proposed standard as documented in RFC 5905. It is backward compatible with version 3, specified in RFC 1305.

## provides or whatprovides
              Is used to find out which package provides some feature or file. Just use a specific
              name  or  a  file-glob-syntax  wildcards to list the packages available or installed
              that provide that feature or file. 

## For example... when you install http it automatically creates the directory /var/www. Suppose you didn't know how this was created you can find out by using the following command.

$ yum provides [file_path] or yum whatprovides [file_path]

# find out the origin of /var/www
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c3 ~]# yum provides /var/www

YUM vs RPM

The Red Hat Package Manager or RPM is the default package manager for Linux distributions that use packages with the same name. Initially developed by Red Hat, it eventually found widespread acceptance in a lot of Linux distributions. YUM stands for Yellowdog Updater Modified and is a front end for Linux distributions that utilize the RPM package format. Both of these are only usable with RPM based distros and are not usable with those that use debian packages like Ubuntu.

Although RPM is a very robust tool that a lot of users are already familiar with, there are still some minor flaws that are an annoyance to users. The most prominent problem is a state commonly referred to by most people as ‘dependency hell’. This problem occurs with packages that depend on a lot of other packages, some of those packages also depend on a lot of other packages. It is common knowledge that you must install all dependencies for the program to work correctly. RPM is unable to automatically do this for you. It can only check whether all the required packages are installed prior to installing the needed package. Manually tracking and installing each dependency is a major chore for most people who only want to install a single package initially.

YUM is capable of tracking the dependencies of a package and installing them prior to installing the package that the user wanted to install. This simplifies the whole process as you need only know the name of the package that you want to install and not worry whether the required packages have been installed or not. Packages that can’t be found on the system are searched for in the repositories that are available to the system.


Although both RPM and YUM are what really installs the packages, you would probably not be using either of those unless you are proficient with command lines and the various parameters that need to be passed. To make it easier for ordinary people to quickly grasp total control of their system, there are various graphical user interfaces or GUIs that can be used on top of either YUM or RPM. These GUIs are what people commonly see and interact with and not YUM or RPM.

Summary:

1. RPM is a package manager while YUM is a frontend that can be used with RPM.

2. The RPM package manager is unable to track dependencies while YUM can.

Adding a YUM Repository

To define a new repository, you can either add a [repository] section to the /etc/dnf/dnf.conf file, or to a .repo file in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. All files with the .repo file extension in this directory are read by DNF, and it is recommended to define your repositories here instead of in /etc/dnf/dnf.conf.
DNF repositories commonly provide their own .repo file. To add such a repository to your system and enable it, run the following command as root:

yum config-manager --add-repo=repository_url
…where repository_url is a link to the .repo file.

*************************************************************************
