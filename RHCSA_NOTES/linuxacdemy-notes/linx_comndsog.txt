HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD (RED HAT LINUX)

1. Reboot machine 
# At GRUB bootloader
When prompt to select OS press 'e'(for edit mode)

2. Locate the kernel line and navigate to the end of the line.
Add 'rd.break' (Ram Disk break)

3. Continue with bootup by pressing ctrl+x

4. mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd
typed password twice
touch /.autorelabel
exit﻿

HOW TO RESET/RECOVER ROOT/USER PASSWORD (Ubuntu 16.04)

# This was performed and successful on my infoset-ng server (andre@suerte) 
# IP address 10.0.0.100

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

TWO OPTIONS TO CONTINUE:

OPTION 1: Delete everything after 'ro'(sometimes it will say splash screen....) and append the following:

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

# add this:
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root rw init=/bin/bash

Press ctrl+x to continue reboot

You will now be in /bin/bash as root like so:
root@(None):/# 

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

Exit by running:
exit

****************************
OPTION 2:

1. Reboot the system
- At the GRUB menu quickly press 'e' to enter edit mode on the kernel.

2. Find the line beginning with 'linux' and place cursor there, press 'end' key to jump to the end of the line. (you should see 'ro' as the last command (this stands for 'read only')

# this is what you should see
root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro
root=/dev/mapper/suerte--vg-root ro

3. Now instead of deleting anything we can just add to at the end like so:

root=/dev/mapper/<$HOSTNAME>--vg-root ro init=/bin/bash

4. Press ctrl+x to continue boot

5. Here is where it differs from OPTION 1
- at the moment we don't have the ability to 'write' on the file system, only 'read'(ro)
- you can verify this by running:
mount 

Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (ro,relatime,data=ordered)

To write to the file system:
mount -o remount,rw / 
this allows us to now read and write to the file system at / (root).

check that you have ability to 'rw'
Output: /dev sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Here you can reset the password
1. FOR CHANGE OF ROOT PW
passwd root

2. FOR CHANGE OF A SPECIFIC USER
passwd <user_name> (e.g archie)

You will then be prompt to enter the NEW unix PS and confirm it

Type : sync 
to apply the changes
sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

How can we change root password
Here are a few ways I can think of, from the least intrusive to the most intrusive.

Without Rebooting
With sudo: if you have sudo permissions to run passwd, you can do:

$ sudo passwd root

Enter your password, then enter a new password for root twice. Done.

Editing files: this works in the unlikely case you don't have full sudo access, but you do have access to edit /etc/{passwd,shadow}. Open /etc/shadow, either with sudoedit /etc/shadow, or with sudo $EDITOR /etc/shadow. Replace root's password field (all the random characters between the second and third colons :) with your own user's password field. Save. The local has the same password as you. Log in and change the password to something else.

###############################################################################################

HOW TO LIST ALL USERS ON SYSTEM WITH A HOME DIRECTORY

1. Run as Root
2. # cat /etc/passwd | grep /home*


##############################################################################################

***PRACTICE RHCSA QUESTIONS***

1. Set up an account for a new System Administrator, Jason, who has just joined your team. His full name is Jason Doe, his shell is bash, he is a member of a new group called admin. His user quota at /home is 100Mb.Jason can execute any command as root but has to supply his own password at each request.


1.Run as Root (su -)

2. # create the group admin with a gid(group ID) of 601
command: groupadd -g 601 admin

3. # add the user to group 601, allow shell access in /bin/bash, add a home directory at /home/jason, -c comment full name

command: useradd -g 601 -s /bin/bash -d /home/jason -c "Jason Doe" jason

How to search the linux repository for a specific program name:
# use this command to search for what you think a program is called. 
apt-cache will return similar results to help you determine the exact name of the program you are looking for along with a short description.
# be sure to use a (*) at the end of the program name to include 'all' files 
when searching.

	$ sudo apt-cache search <name of program*>
	$ sudo apt-cache search Django*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To repeat the previous command use:

	$ sudo !!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To switch users use:

	$ su <name of user>
	$ su carolina
	$ su andre

# To change to Root user use:

	# 'Super user do, super user'.
	$ sudo su

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To manage packages/install, remove, update, and upgrade  use the 'apt-get' program
# command usage: sudo apt-get <action> <file or program you want action performed on>
# example:
	$ sudo apt-get install <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get install bluefish

# To remove a program use:
	$ sudo apt-get remove <name of program(package)>
	$ sudo apt-get remove bluefish

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# To make a 'matrix' style effect on command line use this:

	$ while (true) do echo -n "your message"; done

# To kill task: ctrl z

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To check if a program or specific package is install on your local machine use:

	$ apt-cache policy <name of program>
	$ apt-cache policy python3
	output:
		python3:
			Installed: 3.5.1-3
			Candidate: 3.5.1-3
		Version table:
			*** 3.5.1-3 500
			500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
			100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

# This will tell you if it exists on the machine and where it is installed.

# To check a known non-exsistant program output look like the following:
	$ apt-cache policy bluefish
	output:
		bluefish:
		  Installed: (none)
		  Candidate: 2.2.7-2
		Version table:
		2.2.7-2 500
		500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages

# Installed = NONE

# FILE PERMISSIONS AND FILE OWNERSHIP
--------------------------------------

USE:  
	$ ls -l (list with 'long view) 
to show files with permissions and user/groups

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

drwxrwxr-x 2 andre andre  4096 Jun 17 17:44 Command_Line_Notes

In the order of output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.exe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-file permissions (drwxrwxr)
number of links (1)
owner name (root)
owner group (root)
file size (2048)
time of last modification, and
file/directory name (Jan 13 07:11 <name of file/directory>

File permissions is displayed as following:

first character is - or l or d
d-  indicates a directory.
a line(hyphen) represents a file.
l-  is a symlink (or soft link) - special type of file.

three sets of characters, three times, indicating permissions for owner, group and other:
r = readable
w = writable
x = executable

In the example out put above -rwxrw-r--, this means the line displayed is:

a regular file (displayed as -)
readable, writable and executable by owner (rwx)
readable, writable, but not executable by group (rw-)
readable but not writable or executable by other (r--)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



# chown = 'Change ownership' - change to a specific user or 'Root'
command:
	$ chown user:group <name of file/directory> (can also specify a direct path (usr/env<name of file>)

# chmod = 'Change permissions' - allowing what can and can not be done to a specific file or directory.

NOTE**** You can add -R to both chown, and chmod to make the command recursive to all files in a directory.

EXAMPLE:
	chown -R user:group <name of directory>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command syntax[edit]

	$ chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...][3]

Usual implemented options include:

-R recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories
-f force, forge ahead with all objects even if errors occur
-v verbose, show objects processed
If a symbolic link is specified, the target object is affected. File modes directly associated with symbolic links themselves are typically never used.

To view the file mode, the ls or stat commands may be used:

$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh

-rwxr-xr--  1 dgerman  staff  823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh
$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh

754

The r, w, and x specify the read, write, and execute access, respectively. The first character of the ls display denotes the object type;
a hyphen represents a plain file. This script can be read, written to, and executed by the owner, read and executed by other members of the staff group and can also be read by others.

Octal modes[edit]
See also: Octal notation of file system permissions

The chmod numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. 
The three rightmost digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users.
The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special setuid, setgid, and sticky flags.

Numerical permissions

#	Permission	rwx
7	read, write and execute	rwx
6	read and write	rw-
5	read and execute	r-x
4	read only	r--
3	write and execute	-wx
2	write only	-w-
1	execute only	--x
0	none	---
Numeric example[edit]
In order to permit all users who are members of the programmers group to update a file

	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-r--r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
	$ chmod 664 sharedFile
	$ ls -l sharedFile

-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
Since the setuid, setgid and sticky bits are not specified, this is equivalent to:

	$ chmod 0664 sharedFile

In Linux, what does the d mean in the first position of drwxr-xr-x? And what are all of the possible letters that could be there, and what do they mean?

I'm trying to learn more about the Linux file permissions system, and I'd like to see a list of the character meanings for the first slot.

It means that it is a directory. The first mode field is the "special file" designator; regular files display as - (none). As for which possible letters could be there, on Linux the following exist:

d (directory)
c (character device)
l (symlink)
p (named pipe)
s (socket)
b (block device)
D (door, not common on Linux systems, but has been ported)

# Creating New files, directories. Removing and deleting files/directories

Commands:

	$ touch - creates files
EXAMPLE:
	$ touch <nameoffile.extension_type>

	$ touch file.txt file2.txt file3.txt file.py file4.cpp file5.html file6.html
** This creates 6 new files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mkdir(make directory)- creates a new empty directory

cp(copy)- how to copy files to a new location

	$ cp <name of target file> <specific directory path>
	$ cp pythonNotes /Documents/tutorials/python

** WHEN INSIDE OF SPECIFIC DIRECTORY**
rm(remove)- removes files and directories
	$ rm file.txt

To remove all files from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm ./*

To remove all files with a specific file extension use:
	$ rm ./*.<extension_type>
	$ rm ./*.html

** WHEN NOT IN SPECIFIC DIRECTORY **

To remove all file from a directory but keep the directory use:
	$ rm <nameofdirectory>/*
	$ rm Documents/*

To remove the directory use:
	$ rm -rf <nameofdirectory>
	$ rm -rf schoolnotes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To move a file use:
	$ mv filename <destination>
	$ mv file1.txt /Documents/newdir

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIND COMMAND***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# use this to find specific files, file extensions, file sizes, as well as specific directories.

Command:
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"
	
	# you can also specify a specific directory in the search like so
	# This command reads as: 
		find in the /etc directory all file types, ignore case and return all with a .conf extension.
	$ find /etc -type f -iname "*.conf"



$ find . -type f -iname "*.html"

find = command
. = in the current directory
-type f = the type we are searching for is 'f' for file.
-iname = means to ignore case (upper/lower) this will return all
"" = name of specific file or name of specific extension type
* = wild card for searching for ALL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GREP Command***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Use grep to find specific items within a file

Command:
	$ grep <"what you are looking for> <name of file to look in>
	$ grep "function" file1.py

# Search all files within current directory, ignoring case(case insensitive)
	$ grep -i "function" ./*


***USE THIS COMMAND TO SEARCH FOR MOST INSTANCES WITHIN A FILE****
# Search and return with line number where instances of the search string are found.
	$ grep -i -n "config" ./*


# *** YOU CAN ALSO USE GREP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 'FIND' COMMAND***

	# you can run a find command as normal and at the end of the command add the flag -exec(execute)
	# -exec takes the grep command argument
	# at the end of your grep command you need to end the statement with {} +


	# this will search and find and return...
	$ find . -type f -iname "*.php" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} +

		-find in the current directory
		-all file types
		-ignoring case(case insensitive)
		-search all with .php extentions
		THEN
		- Execute grep
		- ignoring case
		- show line numbers
		- return 'config' as search
		- {} + end the execute statement

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Redirect the output of a command to a file by printing and creating a file to add output in.
	- you do this by running the command on the output source
	Example:
		$ find . -type f -size -20k -iname "*.py" -exec grep -i -n "config" {} + | tee drelog.txt

	# This searches the current directory looking for files less than 20 kilobytes with the .py extention. 
	# Then executes grep case insensitive, displaying line numbers searching for string 'config' 
	# Then it pipes the result into a file named 'drelog.txt' as well as prints the output to the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# PROCESSES

# Use 'top' or 'htop' to view in real-time current processes.

# To view all background tasks use the command:
	$ ps aux

# To view a specific app or program use ps aux and pipe the app or program as the argument.
	$ ps aux | python3

# To view processor ID's (PID) use the command pgrep.
	$ pgrep chrome

# To kill a single app or process use grep to return the proccessor id and then kill it based on it's id.
	$ pgrep chrome
		output:
		1568
		3369
		1497
		7812
	# To kill a specific process use this command.
		$ kill -9 1497

# Likewise to kill all of the proccesses use:
	$ killall chrome

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Why you don't have a root password

While you can create a password for the superuser account allowing you to log in as root with su, it's worth mentioning that this isn't the "Ubuntu" way of doing things. Ubuntu have specifically chosen not to give a root login and password by default for a reason. Instead, a default Ubuntu install will use sudo.

Sudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties. In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given "sudo" permission by default.

Anybody with "sudo" permission may perform something "as a superuser" by pre-pending sudo to their command. For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
You will see this usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web. It's an alternative to doing this.

su
apt-get dist-upgrade
exit

With sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password. If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password. You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user. And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.

Sudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges. With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout. This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.

With sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:

sudo su
... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.

And similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.

However when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command. It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).

Just to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root as described in @Oli's answer, if you specifically want to do things this way instead. I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.

# Some useful commands for providing 'help' within the terminal environment.
1. Use man-pages of (man <command> -- these pages give a great over-view of the command and any additional arguments.
2. Use '--help' (E.g cp --help)-- This provides a quick reference of how a command should be structured. Args within [](square brackets) are optional. Args that are NOT in [] are required.
3. Use 'info' (info <command>) -- Much like the man pages, these provide info in addition to the 'man-pages'.
4. If you know of a command but can't rememeber the exact name, you can search the system. You do this by using the 'apropos' command (E.g apropos cp).

Gzip and bzip2 are functionally equivalent. (There once was a bzip, but it seems to have completely vanished off the face of the world.) Other common compression formats are zip, rar and 7z; these three do both compression and archiving (packing multiple files into one). Here are some typical ratings in terms of speed, availability and typical compression ratio (note that these ratings are somewhat subjective, don't take them as gospel):

decompression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > 7z > rar > bzip2
compression speed (fast > slow): gzip, zip > bzip2 > 7z > rar
compression ratio (better > worse): 7z > rar, bzip2 > gzip > zip
availability (unix): gzip > bzip2 > zip > 7z > rar
availability (windows): zip > rar > 7z > gzip, bzip2
As you can see, there isn't a clear winner. If you want to rely on programs that are likely to be installed already, use zip on Windows (or if possible, self-extracting archives, as Windows doesn't ship with any of these) and gzip on unix. If you want maximum compression, use 7z.

Rar also has downside that, as far as I know, there is no free software that creates rar archives or that can unpack all rar archives. The other formats have free implementations and no (serious) patent claims.

# Archiving a directory to a file using tar

tar -czvf [destination_name].tar.gz or .tgz(also common) [original dir]
***NOTE: arg 'f' MUST be the LAST ARGUMENT otherwise you will receive an error*****

E.g: tar -czvf jupyternotebookbackup.tar.gz jupyternotebook/
# now ls or ll the .tar.gz file and notice the file size... rather large and not practical for email or sending. In this case we need to compress the file using gzip.

command: gzip [*.tar.gz file]

# In order to view the contents of the tar file run:
tar -tf [*.tar.gz]

How to unzip .tgz file using the terminal
To extract a .tgz file with tar you need to use,

tar -xvzf /path/to/yourfile.tgz
where,

x for extract
v for verbose
z for gnuzip
f for file, should come at last just before file name.

FILE TRANSFER THROUGH SSH USING 1. SCP or 2.SFTP
(Please read the man pages for these)

Both scp and sftp use the ssh port 22 because it is encrypted this is the safe way of file 
transfering. NOTE!!! 'Telnet' is unsecure and should be avoided if possible.


# scp [file...file...file] username@ip_address(:and specify where to put the files)
# (eg below.. transfering test1-4 into CentOS remote server and placing the files into the 
user's home directory.

$ scp test1 test2 test3 test4 user@52.90.15.86:~/

SFTP:

$ sftp username@ip_address

Once logged into remote server you are able to run most linux commands.

# transfers file from the REMOTE SERVER --> LOCAL HOST
# think... put file on LOCAL HOST
$ put file_name

# transfers file from the LOCAL HOST --> REMOTE SERVER
# think... get file from LOCAL HOST
$ get file_name

TO EXIT SFTP:
type: 'bye, exit or quit'

IF DISK DOES NOT WANT TO UNMOUNT
*******************************************

Example:
root@andre-ThinkPad-S3-Yoga-14:/mnt/usb_drive# umount /mnt/usb_drive 
umount: /mnt/usb_drive: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)


Solution: Solved by https://chrisjean.com/forcing-a-device-to-unmount-in-ubuntu-linux/

FORCING a Device to Unmount in Ubuntu Linux

I recently ran into an issue where a mounted SSHFS filesystem refused to unmount.

I tried to unmount it from inside Nautilus by right-clicking the mount and selecting Unmount, but this failed with an error message. The error told me that it couldn’t unmount the device and gave a reason of “mount disagrees with the fstab”.

I then edited the fstab (sudo vi /etc/fstab) and commented out the entry for the device. I tried to unmount in Nautilus again, but this time it told me that I couldn’t unmount the device because I wasn’t root and the device was not listed in fstab. I then uncommented the previously commented line and saved the file again.

Time to get dirty. I tried to manually run umount, but it failed:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo umount /mnt/share
umount: /mnt/share: device is busy.
        (In some cases useful info about processes that use
        the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))
[chris@home ~]$ 
This was getting personal now as the previous messages said nothing about the device being in use. I closed out every application and tried again. Same error message.

I followed the instructions and ran man lsof followed by man fuser to find out more about those recommended commands. fuser was the winner.

fuser allows you to find out detailed information about processes that are using specific files or sockets. In addition to getting information, it allows you to kill processes accessing the file or socket. This was exactly what I was looking for.

After reading up on the fuser syntax, I ran the following:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo fuser -km /mnt/share
/mnt/share/: 9004c
[chris@home ~]$ 
This command basically translates into “find every process that is accessing the /mnt/share mount point and kill it”. Since I was unsure of the ownership of the processes that would be killed, I ran it with sudo to make sure that any processes could be killed.

The /mnt/share/: 9004c response means that a process with an ID of 9004 was terminated.

Again, I ran:

[chris@home ~]$ sudo umount /mnt/share
[chris@home ~]$ 
This command cheerily replied with nothing, which is a good sign as it means that the umount command succeeded.

Finally, the mount is unmounted. Now if only I could remember what I was trying to do when this problem happened…

NOTE: ALSO TRY: umount -l (-l for lazy)

HOW TO CONFIGURE LOCAL YUM REPO IN REDHAT LINUX 7

************************************************************

1. Start rhel virtual machine (virtualbox)
2. Make sure to have iso of redhat7.* (dvd.iso)
3. ssh into virtual server

# mount the iso

root@vmrhel:#] mount rhel-server-7.1-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt
---> this should mount the iso as /dev/loop*(usally a number 0-9) (e.g /dev/loop1

# cd into its mount point(/mnt/)
# create directory to contain packages from dvd
root@vmrhel:#] mkdir -p /data/pack


# copy all package files from iso to /data/pack dir
# cd into the dvd.iso and into the 'packages' directory
root@vmrhel:#] cp -rvf * /data/pack

NOTE: This will take some time
*************************************************************************

UNMOUNT ISO

# cd out of the iso mount in torder to unmount properly

root@vmrhel:#] umount /dev/loop0

# cd into /data/pack/

# create the repo
root@vmrhel:#] ls | grep -i createrepo
<createrepo-0.9.9-23.el7.noarch.rpm>

# install the package
root@vmrhel:#] rpm -ivh <package_name> ----> root@vmrhel:#] rpm -ivh createrepo-0.9.9-23.el7.noarch.rpm

# confirm you are in the /data/pack dir

# create the repo file
root@vmrhel:#] createrepo -v .

# now cd back to root home dir
root@vmrhel:#] cd

# add the repo
root@vmrhel:#] yum-config-manager --add="rhel"

# edit the newly created repo config file
root@vmrhel:#] vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.repo

How to SSH to a VirtualBox guest externally through a host
***********************************************************************

The best way to login to a guest Linux VirtualBox VM is port forwarding. By default, you should have one interface already which is using NAT. Then go to the Network settings and click the Port Forwarding button. Add a new Rule:

Host port 3022, guest port 22, name ssh, other left blank.


from command line:

VBoxManage modifyvm "myserver" --natpf1 "ssh,tcp,,3022,,22"
where 'myserver' is the name of the created VM. Check the added rules:

VBoxManage showvminfo "myserver" | grep 'Rule'
That's all! Please be sure you don't forget to install an SSH server:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
To SSH into the guest VM, write:

ssh -p 3022 user@127.0.0.1
Where user is your username within the VM.

Exercise: Filesystem ACLs

Create a second user on the system called "starbuck".  Open a second terminal window for the lab server, and connect as the user starbuck. Ensure you're working as a priviledged user (sudo) or root user while perofrming the lab. The starbuck user will be used to test setting the permissions.
Navigate into the /tmp directory, create two new directories named "dir1" and "dir2" and two files called "file1" and "file2".
Idenity if any of the files currently have extended access control lists associated with them.
Set an ACL for the starbuck user to read and write for file1.
Set the mask on the file1 to read only, then as the starbuck user, attempt to execute the following command: echo "test" > /tmp/file1. Why does this fail?
Set the default permissions on dir1 to read, write and execute for the starbuck user; execute only if it is a directory.
Using setfacl, change the "other" permissions to none on file1.
Remove the default permissions from dir1.
Remove all ACLs on file1.

*******************************************************************************************************************************

SOULTION EXERCISE : FILESYSTEM ACLS

1. Create a second user on the system called "starbuck".  Open a second terminal window for the lab server, and connect as the user starbuck. Ensure you're working as a priviledged user (sudo) or root user while perofrming the lab. The starbuck user will be used to test setting the permissions.

[root@localhost ~]# useradd starbuck; passwd starbuck
Changing password for user starbuck.
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
2. Navigate into the /tmp directory, create two new directories named "dir1" and "dir2" and two files called "file1" and "file2".

[root@localhost tmp]# mkdir {dir1,dir2}; touch {file1,file2}
3. Idenity if any of the files currently have extended access control lists associated with them.

[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2
Note: The files have base ACLs but do not have extended ACLs. We know they do not have extended ACLs because of the lacl of "+" at the end of the permissions listed.

4. Set an ACL for the starbuck user to read and write for file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m u:starbuck:rw file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:starbuck:rw-
group::r--
mask::rw-
other::r--
5. Set the mask on the file1 to read only, then as the starbuck user, attempt to execute the following command: echo "test" > /tmp/file1. Why does this fail?

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m m::r file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:starbuck:rw- #effective:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::r--
Starbuck's Terminal
[starbuck@localhost tmp]$ echo "test "> /tmp/file1
-bash: /tmp/file1: Permission denied
Summary: Starbuck was unable to write to file1 even though they had an ACL with rw, because the mask was setting the "maximum" permissions to r and was masking w.

6. Set the default permissions on dir1 to read, write and execute for the starbuck user; execute only if it is a directory.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -d -m u:starbuck:rwX dir1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1
# file: dir1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:user:starbuck:rwx
default:group::r-x
default:mask::rwx
default:other::r-x
7. Using setfacl, change the "other" permissions to none on file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m o::- file1
[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2
-rw-rw----+ 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2
8. Remove the default permissions from dir1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-default dir1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1
# file: dir1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
9. Remove all ACLs on file1.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-all file1
[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
other::---

umask default makes files as 666(rw-rw-rw) read, write permissions on owner:group:other
umask default for directories is 777 (rwX-rwX-rwX) read, write and execute permissions on owner:group:other

**Notice** how directories by default allow execution, this is because execution is needed in order to change directory(cd) into. However, you do not need execute permissions to ls or cat into a dir.

CREATE AND MANAGE ACCESS CONTROL LISTS (ACLs)
*********************************************************

# file systems that support ACLs by default are 'xfs' and 'ext4'

# create a new user named 'starbuck'
# set the password with 
$ passwd starbuck

# open two terminal windows, one as root and one as starbuck

# cd into /tmp/ directory on both the root and starbuck, this is to demonstrate privledges.

# getfacl - get file access control lists
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# getfacl file1
# file: file1
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--

For  each file, getfacl displays the file name, owner, the group, and the Access Con‐
       trol List (ACL). If a directory has a default ACL, getfacl also displays the  default
       ACL. Non-directories cannot have default ACLs.

       If  getfacl is used on a file system that does not support ACLs, getfacl displays the
       access permissions defined by the traditional file mode permission bits.

       The output format of getfacl is as follows:
	       1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  # owner: lisa
               3:  # group: staff
               4:  # flags: -s-
               5:  user::rwx
               6:  user:joe:rwx               #effective:r-x
               7:  group::rwx                 #effective:r-x
               8:  group:cool:r-x
               9:  mask::r-x
              10:  other::r-x
              11:  default:user::rwx
              12:  default:user:joe:rwx       #effective:r-x
              13:  default:group::r-x
              14:  default:mask::r-x
              15:  default:other::---

       Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning group.
       
       Line 4 indicates the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky (t) bits: either  the  letter
       representing  the bit, or else a dash (-). This line is included if any of those bits
       is set and left out otherwise, so it will not be shown for most files.  (See  CONFOR‐
       MANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17 below.)

       Lines  5,  7  and  10 correspond to the user, group and other fields of the file mode
       permission bits. These three are called the base ACL entries. Lines 6 and 8 are named
       user  and named group entries. Line 9 is the effective rights mask. This entry limits
       the effective rights granted to all groups and to named users. (The  file  owner  and
       others  permissions  are not affected by the effective rights mask; all other entries
       are.)  Lines 11--15 display the default ACL associated with this directory.  Directo‐
       ries may have a default ACL. Regular files never have a default ACL.

       The  default behavior for getfacl is to display both the ACL and the default ACL, and
       to include an effective rights comment for lines where the rights of the entry differ
       from the effective rights.

       If  output  is  to  a terminal, the effective rights comment is aligned to column 40.
       Otherwise, a single tab character separates the ACL entry and  the  effective  rights
       comment.

       The  ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.  The output of get‐
       facl can also be used as input to setfacl.

       PERMISSIONS
       Process with search access to a file (i.e., processes with read access  to  the  con‐
       taining  directory  of a file) are also granted read access to the file's ACLs.  This
       is analogous to the permissions required for accessing the file mode.
********************************************************************************************************************

SETTING THE ACL ON A SPECIFIC USER
**Note** you can either pass the username or the user id

How can I find my User ID UID from terminal?

There are a couple of ways:

Using the id command you can get the real and effective user and group IDs.

id -u <username>
If no username is supplied to id, it will default to the current user.

Using the enviroment variable.

echo $UID

******************************************************************************************************

# set the acl on (u)ser 'starbuck' by (m)odifying the the file permissions to (r)ead, (w)rite.
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# setfacl -m u:starbuck:rw file1

**NOTE** you can also use the $UID (user id)
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# setfacl -m u:1003:rw file1

# get starbuck's uid
[root@andre-merten-e7d00e0c1 tmp]# id -u starbuck
1003
