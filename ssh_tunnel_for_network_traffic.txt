Make sure you can SSH from the CLIENT to the SERVER without a password

You need to generate an SSH key and copy it over to the SERVER from the CLIENT.

To generate the key simply run: ssh keygen and accept all defaults.

To copy the key over to the SERVER simply run:

ssh-copy-id cloud_user@10.0.1.100 and enter the password.

Verify that your SSH tunnel works.

For this task you need to have an SSH tunnel set up. To do so, simply enter the following command:
