# How do I save my work done on Docker Jupyter?
Data in containers is not persistent, so as soon as you quit running the container AND remove the container, the data goes with it.

There are a few parts to your problem:

    The "--rm" flag tells the container to remove itself if it an exit state. When you exit the jupyter container, it stops and automatically removes itself. Remove the "--rm" flag from the execution to stop this behavior. You'll still see the container using "docker ps -a", but it will be in an exited state instead of being removed.

    To save data, you need to figure out where jupyter saves it's data and volume mount that location to your host system to preserve it locally. This requires use of the -v flag. For a database, like mariadb, you'd use something like this: docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -v /home/selfuser/data/:/var/lib/mysql --name database mariadb. The "-v" option mounts the /var/lib/mysql directory in the container (where the database is stored) to the host system under /home/selfuser/data/. You can then re-mount that location again and your data should stay preserved. There are other ways to preserve data, but this is usually the easiest method.

    Finally, if you want to keep the container running, but not exit it, you can use a Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q command sequence to detach from a running container.



Docker containers are a good way to keep your dev environment clean. They are by definition stateless, if you want to save data then you have to mount a volume into it. Darcon's comment explains it well: create a folder on your host, let's say /home/YourUserName/jupyter and mount it into the container when you start it up:

docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v /home/<user_name>/jupyter:/tmp sciruby/iruby-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''


This will make every file in your /home/YourUserName/jupyter folder accessible inside your container via /tmp and vice versa! So things you save in /tmp while working inside your container will then be available on your host in that previously declared folder.
