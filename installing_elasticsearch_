Instructions

Your company's business intelligence office wants to use a single node Elasticsearch and Kibana instance to ad-hoc analyze some small-data. They will handle the indexing and analyzing of the data themselves, but need you to setup a CentOS 7 host for them with Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and working together. Since this will be used in production, you should install the Elastic services with a custom YUM repository to facilitate easier version managment and upgrading. You can do that with the following configuration information:

name=Elastic Stack repository for 6.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md

The business intelligence employees will access kibana locally. Since you will be remote, you can access Kibana to check your work with an SSH tunnel using port forwarding, with this command:

ssh cloud_user@your_public_ip_here -L 5601:localhost:5601

help
Create a YUM repository for Elastic products

Create the YUM repo file at /etc/yum.repos.d/elastic_stack.repo with the following contents:

[elastic_stack-6.x]
name=Elastic Stack repository for 6.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md

help
Install Java

We need to install Java before installing elasticsearch with the following command:

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y

help
Install and enable the Elasticsearch service

With our Elastic repo and Java installed, we can now install Elasticsearch:

yum install elasticsearch -y

Run the following to prepare, enable, and start the Elasticsearch service:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable elasticsearch
systemctl start elasticsearch

help
Install and enable the Kibana service

Install Kibana as follows:

yum install kibana -y

Run the following to enable and start the Kibana service:

systemctl enable kibana
systemctl start kibana

To use Kibana remotely open a new SSH connection with the following port forwarding options (be sure to replace public_ip with your actual public IP):

ssh cloud_user@public_ip -L 5601:localhost:5601

Once you have established the SSH session from the previous step, you can access kibana by opening your browser and going to http://localhost:5601
